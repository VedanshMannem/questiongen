API for question gen. Currently supports SAT questions, more coming soon. Try here: https://questiongen-w97p.onrender.com/.

# Why this is better than just using GPT
- GPT questions and problem sets won't reflect actual SAT test ratios
- the types of questions will be really similar (options will be super similar across all the questions you ask it to create)

# Backend
This relies on learned features, using logic skeletons, graph nodes, and algorithmic metadata extraction. Full code can be accessed and the api can be used (under extract-nodes endpoint) to run on any json data you upload.
