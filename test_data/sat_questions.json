Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species.

    "answer_choices": [
      "Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri\u2019s census.",
      "some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
      "Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.",
      "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues\u2019 count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri\u2019s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms\u2019 morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms\u2019 structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers\u2019 decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues\u2019 count and Bianchi and Morri\u2019s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri\u2019s study.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference\u2014it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger."

The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography\u2019s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated.

From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature\u2019s decline.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the \"artistic merit\" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought\u2014if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought.

According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and \u201ca door to nowhere.\u201d The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building\u2019s residents.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn\u2019t address how long someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn\u2019t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa\u2019s apartment building design may be beneficial, but the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists."

      "gift givers likely perceive digital gift cards as requiring relatively low effort to obtain and thus wrongly assume gift recipients will appreciate them less than they do physical gift cards."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of perceptions of digital versus physical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of \"the time spent obtaining a gift\u2026as a reflection of the gift\u2019s thoughtfulness\" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift cards more \"socially acceptable\" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards \"can be purchased online from anywhere\" with the fact that physical gift cards \"sometimes must be purchased in person\"\u2014suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text\u2019s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients\u2019 preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the relative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn\u2019t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of these factors. Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable to physical gift cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of ownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the text contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them and discusses how those factors influence people\u2019s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the text, which explains that recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are easier to use than physical cards, not because physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t characterize the effort required to obtain physical gift cards as \"unnecessary.\""

      "It clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the community."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn\u2019t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what\u2019s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn\u2019t change\u2014that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn\u2019t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels."

In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States have yielded fossils of a similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyfish due to their shapes and the appearance of projecting tentacles.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement that, if true, would most directly weaken Caron and colleagues\u2019 claim that the apparent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils are actually ctenophore comb rows. If the fossils are so poorly preserved that they cannot be conclusively identified as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyfish nor, as Caron claims, that they are ctenophores would be supported.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Caron\u2019s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. These fossils are said to be \"of a similar age\" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils from the US and China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron\u2019s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron\u2019s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Although fossil quality is a plausible issue for the research described in the text, nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the fossils from US and China would have been too poorly preserved for proper identification."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative\u2019s content) and syuzhet (a narrative\u2019s arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II. The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can\u2019t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The film\u2019s storytelling methods aren\u2019t the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect.

Mimesis is typically translated as \u201cimitation\u201d in modern editions of ancient Greek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: \u201cimitation\u201d implies that art merely copies\u2014and is thus by definition entirely derivative of\u2014a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating \u201cmimesis\u201d thusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.",

If Plato\u2019s works tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while Aristotle\u2019s works suggest that the term \"mimesis\" can refer to art\u2019s ability to show conditions that don\u2019t currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term \"mimesis\" means more than just \"imitation\" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim- coming to be associated with music and poetry wouldn\u2019t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term \"mimesis\" as it was used by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on Halliwell\u2019s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the issue of art\u2019s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is related to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on Halliwell\u2019s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and reality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art\u2019s relation to reality. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that Plato discussed aesthetics in his early works but didn\u2019t use the term \"mimesis\" until later doesn\u2019t give any indication of how Plato or any other ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and reality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell\u2019s claim that a common translation of the term \"mimesis\" is oversimplified and fails to reflect the varied ways the philosophers understood that relationship."

      "at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than 100% of their maximal speed while pursuing prey."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text\u2019s discussion of lizard species\u2019 use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%\u201339% of maximal speed, 40%\u201349% of maximal speed, 50%\u201359% of maximal speed, 60%\u201369% of maximal speed, 70%\u201379% of maximal speed, 80%\u201389% of maximal speed, and 90%\u2013100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%\u201359%, 60%\u201369%, 70%\u201379%, and 80%\u201389%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn\u2019t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%\u2013100% (8 species total). However, these data don\u2019t complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don\u2019t complete the text\u2019s discussion of lizard species\u2019 use of maximal speed when escaping predators."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years\u20141987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees\u2014grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn\u2019t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees."

      "the best way to support forest health may be to leave large forests entirely untouched."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the potential effects of logging on forest conservation. The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn\u2019t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging."

In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references\u2014that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.\u2014and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting\u2014which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light\u2014many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers\u2019 conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers\u2019 conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting."

The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more efficiently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn\u2019t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New\u2019s bags before he started using sewing machines.

The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don\u2019t cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis. Such a finding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because finding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn\u2019t a barrier to the sea stars.

    "prompt": "While attending school in New York City in the 1980s, Okwui Enwezor encountered few works by African artists in exhibitions, despite New York\u2019s reputation as one of the best places to view contemporary art from around the world. According to an arts journalist, later in his career as a renowned curator and art historian, Enwezor sought to remedy this deficiency, not by focusing solely on modern African artists, but by showing how their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history.",
    "question_text": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the journalist\u2019s claim?",

      "As curator of the Haus der Kunst in Munich, Germany, Enwezor organized a retrospective of Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui\u2019s work entitled El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale, one of the largest art exhibitions devoted to a Black artist in Europe\u2019s history.",
      "In the exhibition Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945\u20131965, Enwezor and cocurator Katy Siegel brought works by African artists such as Malangatana Ngwenya together with pieces by major figures from other countries, like US artist Andy Warhol and Mexico\u2019s David Siqueiros.",
      "Enwezor\u2019s work as curator of the 2001 exhibition The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945\u20131994 showed how African movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War profoundly influenced work by African artists of the period, such as Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq and Thomas Mukarobgwa.",
      "Enwezor organized the exhibition In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present not to emphasize a particular aesthetic trend but to demonstrate the broad range of ways in which African artists have approached the medium of photography."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the arts journalist\u2019s claim about Enwezor\u2019s work as a curator and art historian. In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on modern African artists but also to show \u201chow their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history,\u201d or how their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945\u20131965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel\u2019s exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists fit into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The description doesn\u2019t suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui\u2019s works fit into a global artistic context. Choice C is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945\u20131994 indicates that the exhibition showed how African artists were influenced by movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War. Although this suggests that Enwezor intended the exhibition to place works by African artists in a political context, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the works were placed in a global artistic context. Choice D is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present indicates that the exhibition was intended to reveal the broad range of approaches taken by African photographers, not that the exhibition showed how photography by African artists fits into a global artistic context."

    "prompt": "Male t\u00fangara frogs make complex calls to attract mates, but their calls also attract frog-biting midges, insects that feed on the frogs\u2019 blood. Researchers Ximena Bernal and Priyanka de Silva wondered if the calls alone are sufficient for midges to locate the frogs or if midges use carbon dioxide emitted by frogs as an additional cue to their prey\u2019s whereabouts, like mosquitoes do. In an experiment, the researchers placed two midge traps in a t\u00fangara frog breeding area. One trap played recordings of t\u00fangara frog calls and the other released carbon dioxide along with playing the calls. Bernal and de Silva concluded that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.",

      "More midges were found in the trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide.",
      "The trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls attracted few midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were low but attracted many midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were high."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges regarding the location of male t\u00fangara frogs. The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male t\u00fangara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs\u2019 blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion\u2014that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers\u2019 trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers\u2019 conclusion\u2014that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of t\u00fangara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a finding contrary to the researchers\u2019 conclusion."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Lowell describes an element of nature as an active participant in the experience of a nighttime scene on a body of water. The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reflects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines\u2014the waves\u2014isn\u2019t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn\u2019t present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation presents an image of an element of nature\u2014the moon\u2014it doesn\u2019t mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but instead as static or unchanging (\u201cever and always the same\u201d)."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student\u2019s conclusion about banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20\u00b0C, the gap between the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2 gridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph shows that at 14\u00b0C, 16\u00b0C, and 18\u00b0C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated bananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14\u00b0C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for untreated bananas at 16\u00b0C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18\u00b0C). Since the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps is larger than the gap between the bars at 20\u00b0C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14\u00b0C, 16\u00b0C, and 18\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20\u00b0C ripen more quickly than ethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20\u00b0C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18\u00b0C, 16\u00b0C, and 14\u00b0C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20\u00b0C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20\u00b0C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18\u00b0C, 16\u00b0C, and 14\u00b0C, respectively). The information in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20\u00b0C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas at the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14\u00b0C to about 5.5 days at 20\u00b0C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were associated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature and differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 14\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 18\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C than at 18\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C."

The text then notes that compared to Lima respondents, a much smaller percentage of Quito respondents said they live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text concludes that because a greater proportion of Quito respondents used parks despite generally living farther from them than Lima respondents did, \"greater proximity\"\u2014being closer to a park\u2014\"can\u2019t explain the difference in park use.\" That is, the text makes the point that the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks is caused by something other than the distance of the parks from city residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address whether the researchers had expected a particular result and doesn\u2019t indicate that they were surprised by the difference in park usage between the two cities\u2019 residents. The text simply presents the survey findings without stating the researchers\u2019 expectations. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that there might be inaccuracies in the survey results; the text presents the findings as factual information and uses them as the basis for a conclusion that a certain factor doesn\u2019t explain differences in park usage between Quito and Lima residents. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any sources that predate the survey or suggest that the difference in proportions was calculated using such sources.

Eight-year-old Heidi and her friend\u2019s grandmother are looking at some illustrated books.\n\nHeidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.",

      "Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama\u2019s books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.",
      "Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama\u2019s books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama\u2019s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that\u2019s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi\u2019s eyes as \u201cglowing\u201d and states that she \u201cdevoured the scene,\u201d suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as \u201clooking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures\u201d in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she\u2019s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text\u2019s description of the image and Heidi\u2019s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as \u201csplendid\u201d and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi\u2019s eyes as \u201cglowing\u201d and states that she \u201cdevoured the scene,\u201d suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it\u2019s unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep."

      "Romeo and Juliet is the most thematically accessible of all Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies.",
      "experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare\u2019s history plays to his other works."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the relative appeal of different kinds of plays by Shakespeare to today\u2019s audiences. According to the text, Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today\u2019s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and Juliet, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare\u2019s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare\u2019s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare\u2019s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren\u2019t mentioned, there\u2019s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today\u2019s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today\u2019s audiences, it doesn\u2019t suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare\u2019s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies hold continued appeal for today\u2019s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare\u2019s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare\u2019s other works."

      "below 297 km/s."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to give the range of velocities for the LMC from the 1980 value (344 km/s) to the 2006 value (378 km/s), thereby effectively completing the text. The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that Besla and colleagues\u2019 analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Therefore, if a velocity of 378 km/s is too high, an even higher velocity will also be too high. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first to exceed the velocity range required to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would best support Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell\u2019s claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell\u2019s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers\u2019 claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that it\u2019s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.\u00a0 \u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn\u2019t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers\u2019 claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn\u2019t weaken the researchers\u2019 claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn\u2019t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers\u2019 claim."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of conservation approaches for the Mammillaria cactus M. boolii. The text establishes that M. boolii only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-species approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the interactions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists have recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the cactus\u2019s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on M. boolii in Sonora and different approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora would reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In fact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn\u2019t specify how climatic changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the single-species approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself\u2014rather, it suggests that this approach might be too narrowly focused on M. boolii alone without considering the broader ecosystem-related factors that affect its survival."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it would most directly support the student\u2019s claim about the motivation for including explanatory notes with the stand-alone volume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author\u2019s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student\u2019s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because\u00a0the student\u2019s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student\u2019s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers\u2019 and critics\u2019 subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn\u2019t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specifically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume."

The researchers trapped electrons between two semiconductors and then cooled the apparatus, causing the electrons to settle into a crystalline structure. By inserting an ultrathin sheet of graphene above the crystal, the researchers obtained an impression\u2014the first visual confirmation of the Wigner crystal.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Eugene Wigner hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconfirmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal\u2014the Wigner crystal\u2014 and doesn\u2019t discuss crystalline structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues figured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn\u2019t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn\u2019t address the relative importance of each component in that process.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it."

Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that Alexandra has a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes her nighttime departure in a wagon. The quotation says nothing about Alexandra\u2019s emotional state.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Euro-American farmers\u2019 use of Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn\u2019t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn\u2019t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers\u2019 crops were ill suited to the techniques, it\u2019s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benefits of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benefits of the techniques much later."

According to the text, Tannen\u2019s hypothesis is that multiple perspectives presented in a noncompetitive format is more informative than a debate between opposing viewpoints is. If participants who saw a panel of three commentators with various views about an issue answered more questions about the issue correctly than did participants who saw a debate, that would support Tannen\u2019s hypothesis since it would show that participants who heard multiple varied perspectives were better informed than were participants who heard a debate between opposing viewpoints.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable than commentators in the panel is irrelevant to Tannen\u2019s hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more informative to the audience than presenting opposing views of the issue is. Participants\u2019 perception of how knowledgeable panelists are has no bearing on how much participants learn from the panelists.

Participants\u2019 perception of how knowledgeable panelists are has no bearing on how much participants learn from the panelists, and Tannen\u2019s hypothesis says nothing about how informative single commentators are. Choice D is incorrect because finding that participants who watched a single commentator answered more questions correctly than participants who watched the debate did wouldn\u2019t be relevant to Tannen\u2019s hypothesis, which is that hearing multiple varying perspectives is more informative than hearing a debate.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of potential benefits of interruptions in the workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. \u00a0Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees\u2019 sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects.\u00a0\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text presents research findings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn\u2019t tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benefits such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address employees\u2019 motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues.

The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text\u2019s description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population fluctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor."

If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We\u2019d also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This doesn\u2019t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then we\u2019d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of REM deprivation while in the water.

Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superfluorescence at room temperature.

      "Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the sweet potato in Polynesia. The text indicates that the sweet potato is found in Polynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potato was being cultivated by Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in Polynesia long before sea voyages between South America and Polynesia began. The text goes on to note that research by Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez and colleagues has established that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato split from South American varieties more than 100,000 years ago, which is thousands of years before humans settled in Polynesia. If Polynesian peoples were cultivating the sweet potato before sea voyages between Polynesia and South America began, and if Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from South American varieties well before people were in Polynesia, it can reasonably be concluded that humans didn\u2019t play a role in bringing the sweet potato to Polynesia.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t provide any information about when the sweet potato began to be cultivated in South America, so there\u2019s no support for the conclusion that cultivation began in Polynesia before it began in South America.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the sweet potato was being cultivated in Polynesia long before sea journeys between Polynesia and South America began. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to conclude that Polynesian peoples acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples. Additionally, the text indicates that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from the South American varieties thousands of years before people settled in Polynesia, which suggests that the sweet potato was already present in Polynesia when people arrived.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the domestic sweet potato, which is found in Polynesia, descends from a wild South American plant, not from a domesticated South American plant. The only people that the text describes as cultivating the sweet potato are Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples of Polynesia."

Its depiction of Mexican American culture inspired later authors to examine their own heritage within their fictional works. Also influential was the book\u2019s portrayal of the main character, Esperanza, during a pivotal year of her youth. This insightful depiction of a preteen girl encouraged authors who, like Cisneros herself, are Latina to use fictional works to examine experiences from their own youth.",

      "Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros\u2019s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros\u2019s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character\u2019s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn\u2019t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren\u2019t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella\u2019s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren\u2019t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn\u2019t relate directly to the text\u2019s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros\u2019s The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros\u2019s novella, such similarities wouldn\u2019t necessarily be evidence of the novella\u2019s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella\u2019s influence."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomys\u0142 and Mieszko II Lambert that is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to two of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to 1031 CE, and Siemomys\u0142 (\"whose historical actuality is disputed\"), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject of debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomys\u0142 by stating that he is \"said to have ruled\" during the 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn\u2019t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle\u2019s documentation of Siemomys\u0142 relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This indicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether Siemomys\u0142 existed.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text states that the Gesta principum Polonorum\u2019s documentation of Siemomys\u0142 comes from oral tradition\u2014spoken rather than written documentation\u2014unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomys\u0142. This suggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomys\u0142\u2019s existence in the 900s (or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates the opposite: Siemomys\u0142 supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th century, while Mieszko II Lambert ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomys\u0142 is believed to have ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions that information in the written chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum draws its information about Siemomys\u0142 from the oral tradition, it doesn\u2019t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle\u2019s documentation of Siemomys\u0142 relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made about how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers\u2019 conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers\u2019 conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the morphology (form and structure) of sea stars, a type of echinoderm. The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (P. miniata) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star\u2019s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t identify how any particular region of sea stars\u2019 bodies influences the layout of sea stars\u2019 radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn\u2019t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars\u2019 origin, Formery et al.\u2019s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about P. miniata sea stars\u2019 body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between P. miniata and S. kowalevskii acorn worms. The text indicates only that little or no activity was observed in certain types of genes associated with body development in P. miniata, not that those genes turned out to largely differ from body-development genes in S. kowalevskii."

However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn\u2019t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors.

Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars\u2019s northern hemisphere.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers\u2019 conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for \"an extended time,\" that supports the \"wet and warm scenario\" on Mars, which involved a \"prolonged\" period of temperate conditions (and not just a \"brief period of melting\").\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t provide support for the researchers\u2019 conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that\u2019s the evidence that would support the \"wet and warm\" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers\u2019 conclusions, but rather the opposite. A \"massive but short lived influx\" of liquid water is not the same as a \"prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions.\" It more reflects the opposing theory, a \"brief period of melting.\" Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb\u2019s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars (\"wet and warm\" and \"brief period of melting\") involve flowing water, but lava isn\u2019t mentioned at all in the text.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Mahtta et al.\u2019s proposal regarding factors that affect urban land expansion (ULE). According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970\u20132000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000\u20132014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970\u20132000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000\u20132014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions\u2019 relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.\u2019s proposal suggests that Region 1\u2019s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970\u20132000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000\u20132014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.\u2019s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970\u20132000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000\u20132014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more."

We don\u2019t have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there\u2019s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various F. hypoleuca dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference.

Zheng\u2019s claim is that the idea of world music \u201chomogenizes\u201d (meaning makes similar) distinct kinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful oversimplification of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it\u2019s true that mbaqanga and quan h\u1ecd developed separately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn\u2019t make sense to lump them into the same category.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn\u2019t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn\u2019t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the music itself is similar or different. Choice C is incorrect. If true, this wouldn\u2019t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from each other that they should not fall into the same category. This choice doesn\u2019t do that. Choice D is incorrect. If true, this would actually weaken the claim. Zheng thinks it\u2019s reductive or oversimplifying to put distinct musical traditions into a single category.

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses).

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student\u2019s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn\u2019t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China\u2019s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn\u2019t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms\u2019 assets\u2014and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports\u2014were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn\u2019t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn\u2019t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of the challenge researchers face when studying the effects of holding elected office on a person\u2019s behavior. The text explains that it\u2019s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected office has on people because finding people to serve as a control group is difficult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don\u2019t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected office). Because researchers aren\u2019t able to influence who wins elections, they\u2019re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will find it difficult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn\u2019t suggest that finding information about politicians\u2019 behavior is difficult. Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected office on a person\u2019s behavior. Studying people who have already held elected office wouldn\u2019t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause. Choice C is incorrect because the text defines people in a control group as those \"who are otherwise similar to the office-holders\"; selecting people who differ from the office-holders wouldn\u2019t fit the criteria for an appropriate control group."

The text doesn\u2019t discuss how much people spend each month, so there\u2019s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people \u201cwilling to pay much more money\u201d for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself."

The text states that the Minneapolis Institute of Art has more than 90,000 artworks. It goes on to explain that images of a subset of these works can be viewed online, such as an image of Armajani\u2019s drawing Mississippi Delta. The text then presents a student\u2019s claim that online images of art can increase the number of people who experience the work. If more people view Armajani\u2019s drawing online than they do in person, this finding would support the student\u2019s claim about the benefits of putting a work from the museum online. Thus, this finding would most directly support the claim because, if it were true, more people would view Mississippi Delta online than would visit the entire museum in person.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because information about the museum having several works by Armajani wouldn\u2019t address the student\u2019s claim about how putting artworks online affects the number of people who experience them. The quantity of works by one artist that are held in a museum collection wouldn\u2019t support a claim about audience size or the impact of online accessibility.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support Probst and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about the hypothesis regarding the relationship between birds\u2019 bill size and habitat temperature. The text states that although it has been hypothesized that birds\u2019 bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that reflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean bill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and colleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the thrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues\u2019 conclusion because this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm2\ncm squared\n), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (27.56\u00b0C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher that have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills. Similarly, the data about the Bendire\u2019s thrasher support Probst and colleagues\u2019 conclusion because this species has the second-smallest mean bill surface area (1.98 cm2\ncm squared\n), yet its habitat has the highest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (36.57\u00b0C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, the Bendire\u2019s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills. Because data in the table show that the ocellated thrasher and the Bendire\u2019s thrasher have the opposite or near opposite of the hypothesized relationship between bill size and habitat temperature, these examples support Probst and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that this hypothesis isn\u2019t fully supported.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Bendire\u2019s thrasher has the second-smallest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum temperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species\u2019 bill surface area and mean minimum temperature suggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Cozumel thrasher has the second-greatest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table, its habitat\u2019s mean maximum temperature in the warmest month is not \"significantly higher\" than the mean maximum temperatures of the other habitats. On the contrary, the mean maximum temperature of the Cozumel thrasher\u2019s habitat is lower than that observed for the habitats of both the Bendire\u2019s thrasher and the long-billed thrasher. Choice C is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although this choice accurately describes the brown thrasher\u2019s mean bill surface area and habitat temperature, it incorrectly states that the long-billed thrasher has the second-largest (rather than the third-largest) mean bill surface area of the species included. In addition, instead of revealing a lack of support for the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature, the data in this choice broadly reflect the hypothesized relationship."

The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions\u2014including regulating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The VTA is described as \u201ca center for motivation and reward processing,\u201d and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that recent research has identified this pathway, but it doesn\u2019t discuss any previous \u201cwidely accepted claims\u201d about the pathway\u2019s function. The \u201cwidespread acknowledgement\u201d mentioned early in the passage is about the cerebellum alone, not its connection to the VTA. Choice D is incorrect.

Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July.

For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn\u2019t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals\u2019 domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team\u2019s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet\u2014importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle\u2019s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team\u2019s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops\u2014and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep\u2019s and goats\u2019 diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn\u2019t support the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle\u2019s diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements\u2019 crops."

      "farmers would trade agricultural products only if they had already produced enough to meet their own needs."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of scholars\u2019 understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn\u2019t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don\u2019t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn\u2019t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn\u2019t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn\u2019t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars\u2019 mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren\u2019t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn\u2019t have marketplaces, it wouldn\u2019t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don\u2019t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn\u2019t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn\u2019t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn\u2019t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars\u2019 mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products."

But a 2023 report by an international team of researchers details the first direct ballistic observations of antihydrogen atoms under gravity inside a CERN particle accelerator.\u00a0 Corresponding most closely to predictions under gravitational attraction, these observations were thoroughly inconsistent with antigravity.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by acknowledging that in 2022, Dimopoulos et al. were justified in arguing for antigravity on theoretical grounds because although there was no experimental evidence supporting its existence at that time, there was no evidence contradicting its existence either. The text then introduces the 2023 report describing an experiment that produced observations \"thoroughly inconsistent with antigravity.\" Thus, the main idea is that while the study of antigravity was theoretically justified before the 2023 report (due to lack of evidence against it), the report\u2019s findings undermine the rationale for such theoretical consideration since there is now evidence against this hypothetical phenomenon.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN, the text provides no evidence that they were conducted to test conclusions in Dimopoulos et al.\u2019s 2022 paper. Rather, the text presents the 2023 report as new evidence that contradicts the existence of the hypothetical phenomenon that Dimopoulos et al. had considered. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Dimopoulos et al. assumed that unambiguous proof of antigravity would be unattainable. Rather, the text states that they argued antigravity was worth considering theoretically because evidence against it was lacking at that time. At the same time, the results in the 2023 report do not undermine but strengthen the idea that the proof of antigravity might not be achievable. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that there was an \"inordinate focus on theoretical considerations\" before 2023 or that such a focus hindered the development of experimental methods. In fact, the text describes Dimopoulos et al.\u2019s position regarding the theoretical consideration of antigravity as \"rightly argued,\" indicating approval of their approach given the absence of experimental evidence at that time."

The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the vicu\u00f1a), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These data imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36 percent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas\u2019 genetic material). Moreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas\u2019 genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of llamas\u2019 genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the inference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of llamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas\u2019 genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at a greater remove from these ancestors.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca populations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild ancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do. Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the chronology presented in the text. The text states that alpacas were domesticated about 7,000 years ago, but the interbreeding with llamas occurred \"between 400 and 600 years ago.\" The genetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details about what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to infer that llama genetic material was introduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos and vicu\u00f1as contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas\u2019 and llamas\u2019 genetic composition. Therefore, the text does not support the inference that modern populations of guanacos and vicu\u00f1as would likely show traces of ancient interbreeding."

The text begins by describing difrasismo, a device used in Classical Nahuatl poetry. The text then mentions the device\u2019s two functions: a formal one (giving structure to lines of verse) and a ritualistic one. The text indicates that the relation between the words in a difrasismo may appear tenuous without the additional information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture but that the meaning becomes intelligible in the context of that information. Therefore, the difrasismo\u2019s apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the two nouns used in a difrasismo are semantically equivalent; instead, the text indicates that the two nouns used in a difrasismo make up a single metaphor whose meaning is often intelligible only in the context of information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that there\u2019s a relationship between the formal function of the difrasismo and the difrasismo\u2019s intelligibility.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the frequency of difrasismo\u2019s use in Classical Nahuatl is a necessary feature of intelligibility: the text indicates that an infrequently used difrasismo would presumably also be intelligible to members of an Aztec audience who are sufficiently familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture."

The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are \u201cmore likely than others to have particular personality traits.\u201d In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that \u201cbehavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.\u201d Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reflects the main idea of the text.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs\u2019 reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn\u2019t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briefly mentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not the main focus of the text.

The text explains that fan cells\u2014a type of brain cell\u2014are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual\u2019s capacity to form associative memories.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual\u2019s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things.

The text indicates that the proportion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs is considerably higher than the proportion of military veterans in the population as a whole. The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures\u00a0 shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that it\u2019s the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans.\u00a0\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there\u2019s no indication that it\u2019s atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they\u2019ve left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn\u2019t address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys that military veterans may be particularly interested in civilian government jobs due to the familiarity of organizational structures that are already in place, but there\u2019s no reason to think that this interest would mean that more civilian government jobs will start to require military experience."

    "prompt": "Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of, thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals.",

The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student\u2019s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is \u201centirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,\u201d meaning that the spider population wouldn\u2019t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student\u2019s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

If significant periods of sauropod evolution toward larger sizes occurred without increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, that suggests that the evolution of larger sizes didn\u2019t depend on increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe any fluctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, so there\u2019s no evidence in the text to support the conclusion that such fluctuations had different effects on different sauropod lineages.

The text notes that jaguars generally eat land-based mammals, but researchers claim that jaguars in the Pantanal can survive on a diet that includes more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. Finding that the remains of aquatic reptiles and fish appear more often in these jaguars\u2019 waste than the remains of mammals do would support the researchers\u2019 claim, since it would suggest that fish and aquatic reptiles are a more significant part of the jaguars\u2019 diet than mammals are.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because finding that a particular aquatic reptile exists in high numbers in the area would not support the researchers\u2019 claim about the jaguars\u2019 diet. The mere presence of many aquatic reptiles nearby does not mean that the jaguars eat those reptiles, let alone survive on more aquatic reptiles and fish than mammals. Choice C is incorrect. Although finding that aquatic reptiles and fish can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and fish, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and fish and thus would not support the researchers\u2019 claim. Choice D is incorrect because finding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers\u2019 claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. The type of mammals the jaguars tend to eat does not indicate anything about whether fish and aquatic reptiles are part of the jaguars\u2019 diet."

In the text, the narrator states that after arriving at the camp, he found it to be different than he\u2019d expected and that as a result, he felt \"scared, but also excited.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In the text, the narrator describes himself as \"excited.\" Although excitement is a positive emotion, it isn\u2019t as intensely positive as feeling overjoyed is. Moreover, the narrator also notes that he felt \"scared.\" In other words, his excitement (a positive emotion) is balanced with fear (a negative emotion). Given this mixture of positive and negative emotions, it would be inaccurate to characterize the narrator as overjoyed. Choice B is incorrect because in the text, the narrator describes himself as having felt both fear and excitement. Neither of these emotions can be thought of as peaceful and, in fact, are almost the opposite of a sense of peace.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers\u2019 choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker\u2019s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker\u2019s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker\u2019s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn\u2019t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker\u2019s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker\u2019s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker\u2019s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker\u2019s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker\u2019s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker\u2019s convenience. Thus, the text doesn\u2019t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of A. mexicanus. According to the text, A. mexicanus, a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river fish and the cave fish, not that the river fish and cave fish are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species."

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the researchers\u2019 claim that they found evidence that experiencing awe can make people feel more connected to others and thus more likely to behave altruistically (with beneficial and unselfish concern for others). According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers\u2019 claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn\u2019t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn\u2019t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn\u2019t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true\u2014that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn\u2019t necessarily beneficial on its own and isn\u2019t the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn\u2019t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior."

The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did. Because having a lower creep rate means that the material is slower to deform with exposure to stress, as the text explains, this finding suggests that aerospace composites made with the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may be able to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period than those made with the other two polymer-derived SiC fibers can.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it overstates the implications of the study\u2019s findings, which have to do with the rate of a material\u2019s deformation under stress, not the absolute degree of deformation. The text states that Bhatt et al. observed that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did, meaning only that it deformed more slowly over time under constant stress, not that it underwent less deformation overall. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t establish any similarity between the two polymer-derived SiC fibers other than that both had a higher creep rate than the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber did in Bhatt et al.\u2019s study. Moreover, reducing a material\u2019s resistance to creep would mean that the material becomes more susceptible to deformation with exposure to stress and elevated temperatures, which would be expected to shorten rather than prolong the lifespan of machinery made with that material. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the stability of aerospace equipment may be better improved by composites containing nitrogen-treated SiC fiber than by composites containing the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, not the other way around. The text indicates that Bhatt et al. observed that the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than the other two fibers did, meaning that it was slower to degrade under exposure to mechanical stress and elevated temperatures\u2014suggesting that it may remain stable for longer periods."

The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million.

The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A finding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs\u2019 green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A finding that white ice,\u00a0because of its air bubbles, doesn\u2019t change color when it\u2019s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn\u2019t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A finding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that\u2019s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue. A finding that blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the researchers\u2019 hypothesis."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Cretaceous pterosaur Tupandactylus navigans. The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of T. navigans based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons\u2014namely, that T. navigans had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, T. navigans likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that T. navigans would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari\u2019s team would not suggest that T. navigans flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari\u2019s team would not suggest that T. navigans had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari\u2019s team would not suggest that T. navigans had a smaller head than researchers previously expected."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the transition from a stagnant lid regime to a tectonic plate regime occurred around 3.2 billion years ago. The text explains that early in Earth\u2019s history, Earth exhibited a stagnant lid regime in which there\u2019s no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. The text further explains that, by contrast, once Earth began to exhibit a tectonic plate regime, its lithospheric and mantle material began to mix. If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle. And if this material is found in both older and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks, that would imply that the lithosphere was able to mix with mantle material beginning around 3.2 billion years ago, as the researchers concluded.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the quantities of lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the material makeup of lithospheric rocks to that of mantle-derived rocks. Choice C is incorrect. A positive correlation between the age of lithospheric rocks and these rocks\u2019 chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks would mean that the oldest rocks would be the most similar, which contradicts the text\u2019s claim that lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks were completely separate until 3.2 billion years ago.

The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story\u2014that it is \"in Hans Castorp\u2019s favor\" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (\"not every story happens to everybody\"). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story\u2019s value.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that \"not every story happens to everybody,\" the narrator doesn\u2019t state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is \"very much worth telling\" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a \"perfectly ordinary\" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that \"the story itself\" is \"very much worth telling.\" The narrator states that the story \"took place long ago,\" is \"covered with the patina of history,\" and can be told only \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,\" but the story\u2019s age and the way it must be told aren\u2019t presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as \"fondly flatter[ing] himself\" that he has gifts that \"must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.\" In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we\u2019re trying to support.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn\u2019t describe Proudie\u2019s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not \"proved,\" it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie\u2019s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn\u2019t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn\u2019t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Instant Mural. According to the text, the 1974 work Instant Mural involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez\u2019s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time\u2014an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man\u2014people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco\u2019s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that Instant Mural is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: Instant Mural isn\u2019t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals).\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there\u2019s no reason to assume Asco\u2019s work Instant Mural was intended to represent Chicano muralists\u2019 frustration; it\u2019s far more likely that Asco\u2019s members\u2014described as Chicano nonmuralists\u2014were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to Instant Mural focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval\u2019s role. But concluding that Instant Mural represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Instant Mural can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn\u2019t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco\u2019s members faced, regardless of gender."

If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars\u2019 claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this finding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the finding wouldn\u2019t directly support the scholars\u2019 claim that the majority of the game\u2019s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this finding doesn\u2019t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars\u2019 claim about the board game.

By describing Joanna as not being interested in people unless they have \"a \u2018purpose\u2019 in life\"\u2014that is, a goal they are determined to achieve\u2014in which case she is very interested in them, the quotation reveals that Joanna cares only about others\u2019 ambition.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because this quotation indicates only that Joanna has a preference for her father, without giving a reason for that preference; therefore, it doesn\u2019t illustrate the claim that Joanna cares only about others\u2019 ambition.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, A. brevis, and its host insect, the T. nylanderi ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants\u2019 share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study\u2019s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies."

The researchers predicted that the students\u2019 positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations.

To provide advertisers with information about their ads\u2019 memorability, a social media site regularly surveys users about whether they remember ads they had recently interacted with on the site. In a study that drew on this survey data, advertising researcher Kristen Sussman and colleagues noted that different kinds of social media interactions involve different levels of cognitive engagement: commenting on or sharing a post is more cognitively demanding than is clicking on embedded links or on a \u201clike\u201d button. The researchers hypothesized that interactions indicating high levels of cognitive engagement with ad content would result in relatively high levels of ad recall.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it details a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis about ad recall. According to the text, the researchers found that commenting on an ad that appears as a social media post is more cognitively demanding for users than simply clicking on embedded links in such an ad. The researchers then hypothesized that a high level of cognitive engagement with ad content would result in a high level of ad recall, or memory of ad content. This hypothesis would be supported by the finding that users who had commented on an ad were more likely to recall its content when surveyed two days later than users who had simply clicked on links in the same ad.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text compares one form of social media user interaction with ads\u2014clicking on the ad\u2019s \"like\" button\u2014with other forms of interaction\u2014commenting on the ad and sharing it through social media\u2014it does so in order to determine which form of interaction is associated with a higher level of ad recall. The text doesn\u2019t note whether users were more likely to click on the \"like\" button than they were to interact with the ad in other ways. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the study attempted to track whether social media users purchased the advertised product or to determine which form of interaction with ad content was more strongly associated with making a purchase. Choice D is incorrect. Finding that social media users who shared an ad forgot the content one week later would weaken, not support, the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that cognitive engagement is associated with a high level of recall."

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada\u2019s coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant\u2019s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows\u2019 health overall.",

      "At several sites not included in the study, eelgrass meadows\u2019 health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.",
      "At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there\u2019s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don\u2019t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn\u2019t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn\u2019t weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn\u2019t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn\u2019t undermine Foster\u2019s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster\u2019s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn\u2019t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster\u2019s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots."

      "the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student\u2019s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn\u2019t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn\u2019t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain\u2019s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony\u2019s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next. Choice D is incorrect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican dialect of Spanish is different from others, it does not discuss how speakers of different dialects are able to understand each other."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Gross and Altman\u2019s book is a \"valuable resource\" because it\u2019s a \"complete, uncensored, unauthorized oral history\" that features accounts from people involved with \"every Star Trek television series and film\" made. However, the text also points out an inherent shortcoming of the oral history approach used by the book\u2019s creators: the lack of an authorial voice that could unify the many accounts into a coherent narrative. Thus, the text\u2019s main idea is that while the book\u2019s attempt at presenting a comprehensive oral history of the Star Trek franchise is a worthwhile one, the approach the creators selected has an important limitation.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

The text indicates that HILDA is a longitudinal study\u2014it involves repeated observations over a long time\u2014and that the \"need for years of data collection\" is what causes it and most other longitudinal studies to have high costs. The text then contrasts such studies with more straightforward studies, using the example of a fitness study that wants only to find out how many regular exercisers in a particular location do weight training, that may not demand a large budget. The contrast emphasized in the text most directly suggests that the fitness study may cost less than a study like HILDA because the fitness study aims only to determine a current percentage and thus can be completed well without extending data collection over years.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a contrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years. The fitness study is described as trying merely to gather information about a current behavior (how many regular exercisers do weight training) rather than track trends over time, which suggests that costs could remain low because expensive longitudinal methods would not be needed, not because they would be suitable.

The text indicates that Rosenswig, L\u00f3pez-Torrijos, and colleagues concluded that there is a cultural link between the city of Izapa and the 41 smaller settlements they located around the city. According to the text, the researchers reached this conclusion because Izapa and the settlements are of the same age and configuration in that all have a pyramid to the north and a plaza to the south. Thus, the main idea of the text is that researchers have inferred that Izapa was related to the smaller settlements that surrounded it based in part on the similarity of their construction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses a similarity between how structures in Izapa and nearby settlements are arranged, the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the arrangement in Izapa is based on those of the nearby settlements. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that residents of Izapa and its surrounding settlements may have performed the same cultural ceremonies, the text doesn\u2019t discuss the ceremonies\u2019 importance for the residents. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes findings about Izapa, it doesn\u2019t specify how much archaeologists have learned about Izapa over the years. Additionally, while the text indicates that the discovery of the 41 smaller settlements surrounding Izapa was made in present-day Chiapas and thus may be of recent date, this is a detail in the text, not its main idea."

The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf species\u2014in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there\u2019s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The life span of gray wolves is never mentioned in this text, so we have no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This is too extreme.

      "begin developing more ears of corn on each plant than the tallest variety of corn currently does."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about a trade-off in growing shorter varieties of corn. The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn varieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears of corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the corn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest reliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn varieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival advantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the potential reduction in ears per shorter plant.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in strong winds, implying that taller plants\u2014not shorter ones\u2014have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for inferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the opposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t provide information about the land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons. The text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and \u201960s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields and that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn\u2019t compare land-use requirements of these crops. Choice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the relationship between height and corn production described in the text. The text explicitly states that greater height allows individual plants to produce more ears of corn, which suggests that shorter varieties would produce fewer ears per plant, not more. The text therefore provides no basis for concluding that shorter varieties would begin developing more ears than the taller varieties currently do."

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren\u2019t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn\u2019t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement\u2019s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn\u2019t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn\u2019t imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that any objects were damaged; rather, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement\u2019s founding suggests that those items were brought to Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment."

The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table\u2014when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g\u2014and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi."

The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants\u2019 medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations\u2019 lands.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities\u2019 languages. Given this relationship, it is unlikely globally dominant languages would borrow Indigenous vocabulary pertaining to \u00a0plants\u2019 medicinal uses.

The quotation provides several details about the sailor, including that it was his custom to remain silent. However, the quotation does not relate these details to the narrator\u2019s experience of being frightened of the sailor.

The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn\u2019t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn\u2019t available until the early 1900s doesn\u2019t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge\u2014and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers\u2014of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s.

The street is nice in this light, [Lutie] thought. It was swarming with children who were playing ball and darting back and forth across the sidewalk in complicated games of tag. Girls were skipping double dutch rope, going tirelessly through the exact center of a pair of ropes, jumping first on one foot and then the other.\n\n\u00a91946 by Ann Petry",

The narrator goes on to describe what Lutie can see in the street: children playing ball or tag and girls skipping rope. Thus, what is happening in the text is that Lutie is observing the appearance of the street at a particular time of day and the events occurring on it.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although Lutie is observing children playing games on her street, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that she is annoyed by the noise of the games. Instead, the text says that Lutie thinks the street looks nice in the light of the sunset. Choice C is incorrect. Although Lutie is observing children playing games on her street, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that she is puzzled by the rules of the games. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that Lutie doesn\u2019t want to interact with her neighbors or that she is in her apartment alone. All the text indicates about Lutie is that she is watching the events on the street and thinks the street looks nice in the light of the sunset."

Hui and colleagues found that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can encourage customers to make spontaneous purchases. The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items\u2019 new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren\u2019t in their usual place. The quotation therefore supports the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn\u2019t find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated.

Thus, the quotation doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn\u2019t carry those products, so the quotation doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases."

In fact, a species may have adaptations enabling it to produce a toxin with multiple uses. Finding that the venom used by the Panamanian scorpion Centruroides granosus to subdue prey also inhibits growth of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Dumas G\u00e1lvez and colleagues conclude that the particular form of venom production observed in C. granosus may have propagated through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Dumas G\u00e1lvez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the venom produced by the scorpion species Centruroides granosus helps mitigate, or reduce, risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success. According to the text, G\u00e1lvez and colleagues found that the venom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, a pathogen that, if ingested by C. granosus, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in species preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus\u2019s digestive juices after ingestion, this would suggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli-infected prey safe for consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus\u2019s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen\u2019s growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system wouldn\u2019t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn\u2019t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when venom isn\u2019t used would weaken rather than strengthen G\u00e1lvez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that a particular form of venom production spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E. coli isn\u2019t actually a risk to C. granosus when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can detect and avoid consuming E. coli-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production is the primary factor that reduces C. granosus\u2019s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn\u2019t clearly support the conclusion that C. granosus\u2019s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is incorrect because G\u00e1lvez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli, and a finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don\u2019t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus\u2019s particular form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding."

The text indicates that Moses and colleagues analyzed infrared imaging and spectroscopy data about Neptune obtained in different years by various instruments. The table lists the observatories where these instruments are housed, the type of data each instrument collected (infrared imaging or spectroscopy), and the years in which the instruments\u2019 observations were made.

      "oxygenation in the Alboran Sea tended to be substantially higher than oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues\u2019 conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph\u2019s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral\u2019s decline near the Mauritanian coast.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral\u2019s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral\u2019s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after\u2014because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after\u2014the graph doesn\u2019t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral\u2019s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn\u2019t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast."

According to the graph, Ouluj\u00e4rvi had surface ice for nearly 200 days in the winter of 1980\u201381 but only about 160 days of ice in the more recent winter of 2005\u201306, evidence of a clear decline in the duration of surface ice between these time periods.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it focuses on only one period of time (the early 1980s). Thus, the data it cites don\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s claim, which compares the duration of surface ice across two specific periods of time (the early 1980s and the mid-2000s). Choice B is incorrect because although it accurately describes data from the graph, it contradicts the researcher\u2019s claim about declining surface ice duration. It describes an increase, not a decline, in the duration of surface ice on Lake Neusiedl between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s (from about 80 days in 1980\u201381 to about 100 days in 2005\u201306).

The graph could indicate that both Lake Neusiedl and Ouluj\u00e4rvi had more than 105 days of ice in the winter of 2005\u201306, but on its own, this information doesn\u2019t demonstrate a decline in ice duration between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s."

Karenin is a dog that belongs to Tomas and Tereza.\n\nKarenin was not overjoyed by the move to Switzerland [from Prague]. Karenin hated change. Dog time cannot be plotted along a straight line; it does not move on and on, from one thing to the next.

In Prague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or moved a flower pot, Karenin would look on in displeasure. It disturbed his sense of time.

      "As a dog, Karenin possesses a sense of time that involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.",
      "After he\u2019s moved to a new home, Karenin\u2019s negative response to changes has become more pronounced.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza\u2019s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn\u2019t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin\u2019s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin\u2019s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs\u2019 circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"\u2014that is, always in a regular and predictable way."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers\u2019 conclusion about whitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt nearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to herbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of herbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren\u2019t exposed to any chemicals from nearby tomato plants and weren\u2019t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels of these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is more than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that weren\u2019t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to defend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then subsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which is less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby plants\u2019 defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection, thereby supporting the researchers\u2019 conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that induce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less jasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended against microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference to the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be impossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants\u2019 defenses to different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. The graph shows that plants in all three conditions produced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produced about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested, which is less than the amount produced by control plants (about 140 nanograms per gram of dry weight), and although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested (which is more than the amount produced by control plants) and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than the approximately 120 nanograms per gram of dry weight produced by control plants), this wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants preferentially defend against microbial infection\u2014that is, that they increase their levels of salicylic acid and decrease their levels of jasmonic acid relative to control plants. Rather, the data would suggest that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants reduces plants\u2019 defenses against herbivory, but these data wouldn\u2019t indicate that whiteflies induce plants to redirect their defenses to guard against microbial infection. Furthermore, the data concerning plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants merely indicate that these plants increase their defenses against both herbivory and microbial infection when infested by whiteflies."

One reason for Izquierdo\u2019s relative obscurity is the enormous popularity of some of her peers. In particular, the painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have so captivated the interest of US audiences that Izquierdo and other Mexican artists from the period often get overlooked, despite the high quality of their work.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "Izquierdo\u2019s work is not as well-known in the United States as it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw so much of the public\u2019s attention.",

      "Izquierdo painted some of the same subjects that Kahlo and Rivera painted but used different techniques than they used.",
      "Few of Izquierdo\u2019s works are in galleries today because she produced only a small number of paintings."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Mar\u00eda Izquierdo was an important figure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn\u2019t received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Izquierdo\u2019s work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public\u2019s attention.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the appearance of Izquierdo\u2019s paintings in galleries in the US during her lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings were displayed more frequently than paintings by Kahlo or Rivera were. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Izquierdo has been overlooked in the US because of Kahlo\u2019s and Rivera\u2019s greater popularity. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss either the subject matter of Izquierdo\u2019s paintings or the techniques she used, nor does it compare these aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo\u2019s and Rivera\u2019s paintings. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention how many of Izquierdo\u2019s paintings appear in galleries today, nor does it state that she produced only a small number of paintings."

The author also calls attention to the fact that Valia is reading in a nearly silent setting by noting that the only sound to be heard is that of the pages being turned.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that Valia is in a chilly setting that causes his hand to become cold, not that he\u2019s in a nearly silent setting. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation emphasizes the size of the book Valia is reading, not a quality of the setting where he\u2019s reading it.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the argument about an unintended effect of the Nagoya Protocol. The text explains that the Nagoya Protocol is an agreement ensuring that Indigenous communities are compensated when their agricultural resources and knowledge are used by corporations. The text then states that the protocol allows corporations to keep their agreements with Indigenous communities confidential, about which some Indigenous advocates express concern. Choice C, when inserted into the blank, gives a good justification for the advocates\u2019 concern: such secrecy could mean that the public is unable to determine whether participating Indigenous communities were properly compensated under these agreements.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text suggests that because corporations can keep their agreements with Indigenous communities confidential, Indigenous communities, not corporations, might not be compensated fairly.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the ability of corporations to keep their agreements with Indigenous communities confidential would place limits on how much research corporations can undertake.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Indigenous communities aim to learn new harvesting methods from their corporate partners.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the claim made by people who favor the traditional view of voter behavior. According to the text, people who favor that view believe that voting in an election doesn\u2019t change a voter\u2019s attitude toward the candidates in that election. If Washington and Mullainathan found that two years after an election, attitudes toward the winning candidate were significantly more polarized among subjects who had voted than among subjects who had been too young to vote, that would suggest that the act of voting did have an effect on the voters\u2019 attitudes toward the candidates, which would undermine the claim that voting doesn\u2019t change voters\u2019 attitudes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding about links between subjects\u2019 attitudes and general political orientation, regardless of age and ability to vote, wouldn\u2019t address the presence or absence of changes in attitudes among those subjects who did actually vote. Therefore, the finding wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the claim that voting in an election doesn\u2019t change a voter\u2019s attitude toward the candidates in that election. Choice B is incorrect because a finding that positive attitudes toward a winning candidate significantly increased in the two years after the election among subjects who had been too young to vote would involve only people who didn\u2019t vote; therefore, the finding wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the claim that when people do vote, the act of voting doesn\u2019t change their attitudes toward the candidates. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that subjects in both groups were more likely to have negative attitudes than positive attitudes toward the winning candidate two years after an election would reflect all subjects\u2019 attitudes at one particular time whether they voted or not, rather than the presence or absence of a change in voters\u2019 attitudes after voting.

    "prompt": "Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth\u2019s surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water\u2019s structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water\u2019s compressibility.",

      "Analysis of water\u2019s molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that TMAO reduces water\u2019s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species\u2019 level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water\u2019s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the researchers\u2019 hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules\u2019 tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water\u2019s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn\u2019t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water\u2019s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases."

The text indicates that although dusky sharks don\u2019t usually eat eastern oysters, they do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of eastern oysters. An increase in the abundance of cownose rays in the region in response to a decline in the abundance of dusky sharks would directly support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis: a higher number of cownose rays would consume more eastern oysters, driving down the oyster population.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that there\u2019s an association between a decline in the regional abundance of some of dusky sharks\u2019 prey and the regional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn\u2019t directly support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region.

The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren\u2019t keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays\u2019 predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn\u2019t bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region.

The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultures there have interacted. The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward. If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes\u2019s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes\u2019s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes\u2019s argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes\u2019s argument that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since Paredes argued that Mexican-American folklore is the product of various cultures interacting in Mexico and the United States, he would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because scholars\u2019 previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes\u2019s argument that Mexican-American folklore mostly reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. The folklore\u2019s origins are independent of scholars\u2019 knowledge of the folklore."

The text states that a tablet discovered in her tomb suggests she \"was in charge of the country\u2019s treasury and other central offices,\" which supports the idea that she had an important role in Egypt\u2019s government.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because since the text explicitly states that Merneith\u2019s husband was a First Dynasty pharaoh, it can be inferred that she lived during the First Dynasty, not after it. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not provide any evidence that Merneith traveled beyond Egypt\u2019s borders often. The text is focused on the archaeological discovery in her tomb and the implications about her potential role as a ruler in Egypt but does not mention anything about her traveling habits.

The text indicates that the team found several instances of the appendix emerging and not disappearing in the lineages of various mammal species the team examined. Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue\u2014a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address any nonmammalian species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t make predictions about the evolutionary future of the species Smith and colleagues examined, and although the implication of the text is that the appendix likely does serve a function for the immune system, nothing in the text indicates that the appendix will become more widespread in the future.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about critics\u2019 skepticism of Bosco Verticale that is supported by the text. The text states that Boeri\u2019s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics\u2019 concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale\u2019s balconies may not thrive in this setting.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells\u2019 efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor\u2019s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor\u2019s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about spray coating\u2019s potential value.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn\u2019t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating."

The text indicates that some songs of the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw people of Canada\u2019s Pacific Northwest region document how the people used terraced gardens in intertidal zones to cultivate clams for food. The text also explains that archaeological evidence shows increases in \"clam size and abundance\" that occurred along with the implementation of this cultivation method, suggesting the method\u2019s efficacy in not just supporting clam yields but also improving them. It follows, then, that the use of intertidal terraced gardens, as described in the songs, allowed the ancestors of modern Kwakwaka\u2019wakw people to maintain clams as a food source and to cultivate larger and more numerous clams.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention anything about cultivation practices among non-Indigenous people in the Pacific Northwest coastal region.

The table shows that only one neighboring species, the common dandelion, has a negative effect value (\u22120.6254).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the table shows that the neighboring species Himalayan balsam has a positive effect value, 0.7905, so it isn\u2019t an example of a neighboring species with a negative effect value. Choice C is incorrect because the table shows that star chickweed is a target species, so it isn\u2019t an example of a neighboring species with a negative effect value.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker has contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of spring. This quotation indicates that the speaker is reclined in a grove listening to a thousand sounds. Even though the speaker is in a \"sweet mood\" and thinking \"pleasant thoughts,\" those pleasant thoughts also bring to mind \"sad thoughts.\" In other words, these lines illustrate the claim that the speaker is having contradictory thoughts while immersed in the sights and sounds of spring.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although this quotation refers to several flowers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a \"bower,\" or shady spot among the trees\u2014details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring\u2014it doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the flowers are experiencing enjoyment. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring\u2014namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up (\"The budding twigs spread out their fan\") to feel the breeze\u2014the quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker feels conflicted about this: the statement \"And I must think, do all I can\" suggests the speaker\u2019s determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn\u2019t certain what the birds are thinking (\"Their thoughts I cannot measure\"), there\u2019s nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Rather, the quotation suggests that although the speaker is uncertain about the birds\u2019 feelings, the speaker believes that the birds\u2019 movements likely suggest their pleasure."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of the means authors use to write and revise their novels. After stating that many authors still choose to draft novels by hand even though computers are now widely used, the text acknowledges the speculation that the opposite choice\u2014using only a computer\u2014would have had an effect on such novels. However, the text then points out that every novel is the singular result of a combination of the particular conditions surrounding its creation. This suggests that it isn\u2019t possible to determine the effect of any single condition (such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, there would be no way to reasonably evaluate how a novel would have turned out differently if it had been written by other means.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that it\u2019s more efficient to write a novel on a computer than to write it by hand; it doesn\u2019t address efficiency at all. Therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to conclude that authors who currently choose to write novels largely by hand should instead work only on a computer to increase their efficiency. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest anything about how successful authors are, regardless of the means by which they choose to write; therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to conclude that authors who write largely by hand are likely to be more successful than those who work only on a computer. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the time it takes to produce a novel, regardless of the means by which it\u2019s written; therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to conclude that novels written by hand take less time on average to produce than those written on a computer do."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively completes the example regarding the ablation rate of iron. The table shows the ablation rates for three elements\u2014iron, potassium, and sodium\u2014found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example\u2014the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types."

These elements include leather fringe and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses worn in the jingle dance, a women\u2019s dance of the Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly associated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking).

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes Gibson\u2019s approach to art. As the text explains, Gibson, who is Cherokee and Choctaw, transforms punching bags into art pieces by applying (or attaching) to them beadwork and elements of Native dressmaking, including leather fringe and the jingles of the jingle dress. The text goes on to say that in most Native communities, the art forms of beadwork and dressmaking are traditionally practiced by women. Therefore, Gibson\u2019s approach to art consists of creating original works by drawing from traditional Native art forms.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Because Gibson incorporates Native art forms into his own original artwork, it can be inferred that he has been influenced by other Native artists, but the text never suggests that non-Native artists have influenced him. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Gibson designs dresses influenced by boxing but instead that he turns punching bags, which are used in boxing, into works of art by applying elements of Native dressmaking to them. Choice D is incorrect. Although Gibson does incorporate beadwork into his art, the text never mentions the colors or patterns that he uses or suggests that his art defies the expectations that people might have about color and pattern in beadwork."

Describing the average September rainfall of Rinc\u00f3n, Ponce, and Isabela as below 8 inches and the average September rainfall of San Sebasti\u00e1n as greater than 8 inches therefore offers an accurate description of the data in the graph and most effectively completes the statement.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it offers an inaccurate interpretation of the data in the graph. The graph shows that in September, Rinc\u00f3n, Isabela, and Ponce all have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti\u00e1n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches.

For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species\u2019 eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles\u2019 egg preferences.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species\u2019 eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles\u2019 preferences for some species\u2019 eggs over other species\u2019 eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles\u2019 preference for some species\u2019 eggs over other species\u2019 eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species\u2019 eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don\u2019t indicate bufadienolide\u2019s role in the tadpoles\u2019 egg preferences."

    "prompt": "In vertical inheritance, parents pass genes to their offspring, but in horizontal transfer (HT), one species, often bacteria, passes genetic material to an unrelated species. In a 2022 study, herpetologist Atsushi Kurabayashi and his team investigated HT in multicellular organisms\u2014namely, snakes and frogs in Madagascar. The team detected BovB\u2014a gene transmitted vertically in snakes\u2014in many frog species. The apparent direction of gene transfer seems counterintuitive because frogs usually don\u2019t survive encounters with snakes and so wouldn\u2019t be able to transmit the newly acquired gene to offspring, but the team concluded that BovB is indeed transmitted from snakes to frogs, either directly or indirectly, via HT.",

The team\u2019s conclusion specifically argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this choice doesn\u2019t mention snakes. Choice C is incorrect. The team argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this answer choice discusses a scenario in which the gene is not transmitted. Choice D is incorrect. Whether or not frog species with BovB are advantaged isn\u2019t relevant to the team\u2019s conclusion about how the gene is transmitted."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of how digital technologies affected the process of book creation. The text explains that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries digital technologies lowered book production costs most significantly in manufacturing and distribution. The text goes on to point out that authoring, editing, and book design are distinct steps in the process that occur before manufacturing and distribution.

Researchers now claim that the ridges\u2019 formation mechanism mirrors that of a strikingly similar pair on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. There, surface water seeped through fissures in the sheet and formed a water pocket that subsequently disrupted the overlying ice, forcing fragments of it upward and outward into peaks, as the pocket froze and expanded. Although Europa lacks liquid surface water, the same process could be driven by the moon\u2019s subsurface ocean.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa\u2019s surface. In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland\u2019s ridges as \"strikingly similar\" to those on Europa. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of when any of the ice ridges formed, either separately or relative to one another. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges."

G\u00f3mez-Baham\u00f3n and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional \u201cgenetic and anatomical divergence\u201d between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies\u2019 tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males\u2019 tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies.

Choice C is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies.

Purcell reveals that these works posit an ethical system in which an individual\u2019s actions are judged in light of how well they accord with the individual\u2019s role in society and how well they contribute to the community. To the extent that these works are representative of Aztec thought, Purcell\u2019s analysis suggests that ______\nblank",

      "the Aztecs would have disputed the idea that the morality of an individual\u2019s actions can be assessed by appealing to standards of behavior that are independent of the individual\u2019s social circumstances.",
      "the Aztecs would not have accepted the notion that the morality of an individual\u2019s actions can be fairly evaluated by people who do not live in the same society as that individual.",
      "actions by members of Aztec society who contributed a great deal to their community could be judged as morally good even if those actions were inconsistent with behaviors the Aztecs regarded as good in all contexts.",
      "similar actions performed by people in different social roles in Aztec society would have been regarded as morally equivalent unless those actions led to different outcomes for the community."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell\u2019s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual\u2019s actions in relation to that individual\u2019s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell\u2019s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual\u2019s actions are rooted in that person\u2019s position in the community and the actions\u2019 effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action\u2019s effects and the individual\u2019s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text\u2019s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual\u2019s action is dependent on the action\u2019s effects on the community and the person\u2019s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors\u2014the other being the person\u2019s societal role\u2014that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles."

If this intuition is correct and we lack an inviolable duty to speak truthfully, what grounds opposition to lying in the first place? Japa Pallikkathayil has advanced one answer by appealing to a duty to respect others\u2019 agential interests: the possession of false beliefs constrains agency, and thus we ought not to impede the formation of true beliefs unless doing so prevents a greater constraint on someone\u2019s agency or an otherwise impermissible end.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying. The text then presents Pallikkathayil\u2019s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others\u2019 agential interests (that is, we have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain agency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best interests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless doing so prevents a greater limitation on someone\u2019s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it might be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in their own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that Pallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions in specific circumstances.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t focus on people\u2019s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where lying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil\u2019s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents Pallikkathayil\u2019s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater limitation on someone\u2019s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about why lies are undesirable but sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text. Pallikkathayil\u2019s argument, as described in the text, wouldn\u2019t lead to an \"inviolable duty to speak truthfully.\" On the contrary, the text explicitly states that Pallikkathayil\u2019s position is that interfering with people developing accurate beliefs is wrong, except when such interference prevents either a more significant limitation on someone\u2019s agency or an outcome that would be unacceptable for other reasons. This indicates that Pallikkathayil\u2019s argument allows for some exceptions to the duty to speak truthfully, making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorrect because Pallikkathayil\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t suggest that if it is permissible to lie in at least some circumstances, then it is unclear whether there are good reasons for opposing lying in any circumstances. Instead, the text presents Pallikkathayil as offering a specific ground for opposing lying (respecting others\u2019 ability to act in their own best interests) while qualifying that assertion by presenting a situation in which lying might sometimes be morally permissible."

The finding that longer-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or Hungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an association between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus nonspeech.

The table shows that pollinators belonging to the genus Xylocopa spent less time on both damaged pin flowers and damaged thrum flowers than pollinators belonging to the genus Osmia did. Choice C is incorrect. The table shows that the artificial damage to the thrum flowers led to shorter average times spent by pollinators on those flowers for only two of the four pollinator genera represented in the table, not three. Furthermore, this choice doesn\u2019t address the effect the artificial damage had on pin flowers; thus, even if accurate, this evidence doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that both floral morph and pollinator genus affect time spent per flower when a flower has been damaged. Choice D is incorrect. While this statement is true based on the information in the table, it doesn\u2019t provide evidence that supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the effect of floral damage on time spent per flower varied by both floral morph and the genus of the pollinator because this choice provides information only about how much time one pollinator genus spent on intact flowers."

The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included \"a reassurance to the United States,\" and made implicit references to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the Haitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

For each of three years, the table presents four book genres and the percentage of total sales for each genre in e-book format. Cookbooks, a nonfiction genre, do not require the reader to read straight through. According to the table, 10.5 percent of total cookbook sales in 2016 were in the e-book format. The 2016 percentage of e-book sales was 36.7 percent in the science fiction and fantasy genre, which are typically stories read straight through from start to finish. The higher percentage of total sales of the story-based e-books in 2016 supports the claim in the text.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it compares the e-book sales of romance books in 2006 to those in 2016. Romance books are meant to be read straight through from start to finish. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are not as commercially successful in e-book format as those that do.

Wells is an important historical figure; Arachne is a \u201cmythical character.\u201d Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt\u2019s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt\u2019s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt\u2019s style haven\u2019t changed over that time."

    "prompt": "An analysis by Alain Elayi and colleagues of coins minted in Sidon in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE reveals a change in their composition over time: while a coin from circa 450 BCE contains about 98% silver and 1% copper, a coin from 367 BCE (the end of Ba\u2019al\u0161illem II\u2019s reign) contains 74.2% silver and 24.7% copper, giving it a relatively yellowish appearance that traders would have noticed. Because coins with a silver content below 80% were widely considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi et al. speculate that a crisis in confidence in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE, which was likely relieved\u2014despite Sidon\u2019s persistent oppressive financial obligations\u2014as a result of Ba\u2019al\u0161illem II\u2019s successor Abd\u2019a\u0161tart I\u2019s decision to ______\nblank",

      "proclaim that the percentage of silver in coins suitable for trade would be raised to a threshold higher than 80%.",
      "keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but decrease their weight.",

      "fund the mining of some copper deposits that were not available to Ba\u2019al\u0161illem II."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren\u2019t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that it wasn\u2019t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd\u2019a\u0161tart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins\u2019 weight.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon\u2019s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised\u2014that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade\u2014likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it\u2019s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren\u2019t considered suitable for trade, so Abd\u2019a\u0161tart I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it\u2019s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Pirotta and her team\u2019s claim that East Australian humpback whales may not live only on stored energy during migration. The text explains that it has long been thought that East Australian humpback whales store extra energy during the feeding season and then use that energy to survive while traveling to their breeding grounds. If it were true that citizen scientists have often seen the whales feeding as they migrate to the breeding grounds, that would indicate that the whales sometimes feed and take in additional energy during the journey, meaning that they may not rely only on energy they stored before migrating.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have observed many different types of marine animals feeding alongside the whales would have no bearing on the team\u2019s claim; the behavior of other animals is irrelevant, and without indicating the timing of the observed feeding, the finding wouldn\u2019t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration. Choice C is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have more often observed whales on the way to their breeding grounds than returning to their feeding grounds would have no bearing on the team\u2019s claim. Since it would provide information about the timing of observations but not about the whales\u2019 observed activities, the finding wouldn\u2019t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration.

Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation involves an element of spirituality, it doesn\u2019t discuss literature. The quotation instead focuses on humanity\u2019s actions. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation mainly focuses on the importance of Walt Whitman rather than on the value of literature in general."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Shcherbakova and colleagues\u2019 claim that the outcome of their study is inconsistent with the linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH). The text explains that the LNH holds that there is an inverse relationship between the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity) and the grammatical complexity of that language\u2014that is, that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity decreases, and vice versa. According to the text, Shcherbakova and colleagues focused on two positive indications of grammatical complexity\u2014fusion and informativity\u2014and analyzed their occurrence in over 1,300 languages. If the researchers found a slightly positive correlation between fusion and exotericity and between informativity and exotericity\u2014meaning that to some extent, grammatical complexity increases as the number of non-native speakers of a language increases\u2014their outcome would not be consistent with the assumption that exotericity and grammatical complexity are inversely related (the LNH).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t be possible to say that a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and both fusion and informativity is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the finding would address only grammatical complexity (given that fusion and informativity are aspects of grammatical complexity) and wouldn\u2019t move beyond that factor to address its relationship to the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity), which is the relationship the LNH focuses on. Choice B is incorrect because a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity)\u2014meaning that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity somewhat decreases, and vice versa\u2014would be consistent, not inconsistent, with the LNH, since the text indicates that according to the LNH, there is an inverse relationship between grammatical complexity and exotericity; a negative correlation reflects an inverse relationship. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t be possible to say that a finding of a slightly positive correlation between grammatical complexity and fusion is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the finding would address only grammatical complexity (given that fusion is a positive indication of grammatical complexity) and wouldn\u2019t move beyond that factor to address its relationship to the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity), which is the relationship the LNH focuses on."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Nacional trees\u2019 survival in Piedra de Plata. The text states that the fungus that caused Nacional trees elsewhere to become diseased spreads from tree to nearby tree through the air. The text also mentions that the surviving Nacional trees were found in a hard-to-reach valley in Ecuador. Given this information, it\u2019s logical to conclude that these trees might have avoided infection because they were geographically isolated from infected Nacional trees, which prevented the airborne fungus from reaching them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because early twentieth-century scientists\u2019 lack of knowledge about the infection that affected many Nacionals doesn\u2019t explain how the trees in the Piedra de Plata coastal forest survived. The text is concerned with the physical factors that allowed certain trees to avoid infection, not with scientists\u2019 understanding of the disease. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that the fungus spreads through the air, it doesn\u2019t indicate when this ability was discovered. Moreover, even if the ability to move through the air was recently discovered, that wouldn\u2019t explain how the trees in Piedra de Plata avoided infection in the past. Choice D is incorrect because the value of the chocolate made from Nacional pods doesn\u2019t explain how the trees in the Piedra de Plata coastal forest avoided disease.

Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, and colleagues evaluated this possibility, finding that on rocky planets, atmospheric NH3 likely couldn\u2019t reach detectably high levels in the absence of biological activity. But the team also found that on so-called mini-Neptunes\u2014gas planets smaller than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to Neptune\u2019s\u2014atmospheric pressure and temperature can be high enough to produce atmospheric NH3.",
    "question_text": "Based on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues would most likely agree with which statement about atmospheric NH3?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "Its presence is more likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a rocky planet that could support life.",
      "Its absence from a planet that\u2019s not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably doesn\u2019t have life.",

      "It doesn\u2019t reliably reach high enough concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a biosignature gas."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the researchers likely agree with, given the details in the text. The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH3 could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH3 without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH3 serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH3 in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH3. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH3 to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH3 usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH3 as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH3 that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas."

All but one of the 20 moons are thought to be remnants of bodies that orbited Saturn until they broke apart in collisions. Although the one exceptional moon orbits in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, its orbit is highly eccentric compared to the rest, which may suggest that it has a different origin than the other 19 moons.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "It doesn\u2019t have a retrograde orbit, but it likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits.",
      "Its orbit is so tilted with respect to the other moons\u2019 orbits that it\u2019s neither prograde nor retrograde.",
      "It has a prograde orbit that is likely the result of having collided with another body orbiting Saturn.",
      "It has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that three of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the planet\u2019s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it\u2019s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn\u2019t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon\u2019s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the moon\u2019s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde. Choice C is incorrect because the text merely notes that the moon in question has a prograde orbit without giving any indication of what likely caused that orbit."

Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets\u2019 radius values irrelevant."

Since an aerial robot must lift its own weight along with its cargo, engineer Jiawei Meng and colleagues used a ratio of each robot\u2019s holding force to the robot\u2019s weight to calculate payload capacity, with higher ratios corresponding to greater capacity, concluding that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot\u2019s holding force to the robot\u2019s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T\u2019s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it\u2019s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn\u2019t support Meng and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it\u2019s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn\u2019t support Meng and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,\u00a0 information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of the researchers\u2019 findings about purple sea urchins and sunflower sea stars. The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn\u2019t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn\u2019t suggest that sunflower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there\u2019s no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that sunflower sea stars are generally reluctant to feed on sea urchins. In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only the willingness of sunflower sea stars to consume the type of sea urchins found in barrens (nutritionally poor sea urchins), not how likely other species of sea stars are to consume them."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student\u2019s claim about the film One Night in Miami\u2026. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn\u2019t discuss Powers\u2019s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn\u2019t initially plan to write a story only \u201cfocusing on the meeting itself\u201d but rather had considered writing a \u201cmuch longer\u201d and more expansive work about the meeting\u2019s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn\u2019t discuss Powers\u2019s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film\u2019s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn\u2019t specify to what extent Powers\u2019s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened.

Because the study didn\u2019t account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned to the capuchin monkeys in the study varied in difficulty and that the variety wasn\u2019t taken into consideration. The text doesn\u2019t suggest that the capuchin monkeys couldn\u2019t perform certain tasks, just that some tasks were more difficult to do. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the study\u2019s results are indicative of the abilities of capuchin monkeys but not of other monkey species; in fact, the text suggests that the results may not even be an accurate reflection of capuchin monkeys\u2019 abilities.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the researchers compared results for artificial tasks with those for tasks encountered in the wild, although the tasks described in the text\u2014sliding a panel and putting a straw in a bottle\u2014are presumably artificial."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens\u2019s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that \u201cthe more informed voters are about politics\u2026the more likely they are to vote.\u201d This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens\u2019s claim about how level of information affects voters.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters\u2019 probability of voting, not whether they\u2019re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru\u2019s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth\u2019s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 claim.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a finding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them\u2014that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000\u201357,000 newtons and 35,000\u201363,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000\u2013235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000\u201334,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn\u2019t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson\u2019s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can\u2019t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don\u2019t support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo\u2019s California condors weren\u2019t similar enough to any of the zoo\u2019s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn\u2019t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors\u2019 mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo\u2019s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn\u2019t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo\u2019s female condors lacked sufficient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls\u2019 chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls\u2019 origin.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn\u2019t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There\u2019s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck. \u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn\u2019t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn\u2019t the text\u2019s main idea. Rather, it\u2019s a detail that\u2019s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced."

    "prompt": "J\u00fcrgen Kocka and other historians of capitalism rarely discuss domestic capitalism in Africa before the period of European colonization, implicitly presenting capitalism as external to and imposed on Africa. Crislayne Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have shown, however, that in parts of Africa, returns-focused investment, the establishment of open markets for wage labor, and other features of capitalism predated colonization. One reason for this discrepancy is that historians of capitalism tend to focus on longitudinal economic data drawn from archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.",

      "They likely view capitalism as having been more beneficial for Africa than historians of capitalism do."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that is supported by the text. The last sentence of the text explains that historians of capitalism generally rely on a type of data that requires \"archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.\" Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have demonstrated that features of capitalism including \"returns-focused investment,...open markets for wage labor, and other features of capitalism\" existed in parts of Africa before colonization. Because archival records typically used by historians of capitalism aren\u2032t available for precolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of precolonial capitalism in Africa likely used atypical sources for their studies.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text states that archival records containing longitudinal economic data \"do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.\" If these records don\u2019t exist for precolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars couldn\u2019t derive data from them by any method. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Alfagali and other Africanist scholars define capitalism differently than other historians of capitalism do. On the contrary, the text simply asserts that specific features they found, such as \"returns-focused investment [and] open markets for wage labor,\" are \"features of capitalism,\" which implies scholarly agreement that these activities are capitalist in nature. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate any effects of capitalism in Africa, positive or negative. Rather, the text explains why precolonial Africa has been omitted from mainstream histories of capitalism and presents work by Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that challenges and corrects the historical record of precolonial capitalism."

The text indicates that Wendy Carlos scored three feature films: A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Tron. It also indicates that Carlos\u2019s work on A Clockwork Orange consisted primarily of electronic arrangements of Beethoven compositions and that very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the film. But the soundtrack for Tron consists largely of music composed by Carlos, so it contains more of her original music than do the soundtracks for the other two films. Thus, the main idea of the text is that of the three films for which Carlos is credited, Tron features the most original music from her.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text\u2019s claim that \"very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the film.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the perceived quality of different composers, instead, it discusses how much of Carlos\u2019s original work was used in each of the three films she scored. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t relate to any of the major themes of the text: the work Wendy Carlos did for three feature films, how much of that work was composed by Carlos, and how much of her original work was ultimately used in the film."

The text states that linguists first observed meng- being used as an onomatopoeic tag on social media, which then spread to being affixed to existing words in text posted on social media; from there, it has begun to move into spoken Bahasa Indonesia. As presented in the text, this progression from online usage to spoken language suggests that social media does more than just register or reflect changes in language\u2014it can actively drive such changes.

The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring\u2014that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth\u2019s real size, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring\u2019s formation was important in determining Earth\u2019s eventual size.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn\u2019t indicate that this was an initial simulation\u2014that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring\u2019s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets\u2019 eventual size in the researchers\u2019 simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring\u2019s formation affected the size of the planets.

      "the family\u2019s division into northern and southern branches likely preceded the acquisition of the crop by the Uto-Aztecan tribes."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Uto-Aztecan languages. The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family\u2019s languages; however, the branches don\u2019t have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest\u2014the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family\u2019s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to how some Uto-Aztecan tribes obtained maize wouldn\u2019t directly address the role of language. Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don\u2019t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch\u2014that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn\u2019t directly address the role of language. Furthermore, the text implies that southern Uto-Aztecan tribes probably acquired maize before the northern tribes did, given the evidence that maize originated in Mexico\u2014the location of the best-known representative of the southern branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family\u2014before spreading to the north."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the trend of admirable-trait candidates being rated as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates held true when participants\u2019 own personality-trait scores were factored in, except among participants with high ignobility scores. The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants\u2019 own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants\u2019 ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates\u2019 likability ratings (as participants\u2019 ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates\u2019 likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates\u2019 likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants\u2019 ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 conclusion. The conclusion isn\u2019t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates\u2014it\u2019s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn\u2019t."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist Adam Smith\u2019s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn\u2019t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor\u2019s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor\u2019s importance to Smith\u2019s work.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith\u2019s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith\u2019s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text\u2019s emphasis on Smith\u2019s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith\u2019s metaphor, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals\u2019 selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith\u2019s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith\u2019s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views."

The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage\u2014such as access to phosphorus\u2014from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don\u2019t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don\u2019t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn\u2019t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There\u2019s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn\u2019t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of Feuerborn and colleagues\u2019 findings about sites in Siberia. The text states that genomic analysis of many domesticated dogs from Siberian sites dating from the last 11,000 years revealed that the dogs represented a genetically isolated population of breeds (that is, they didn\u2019t reproduce with dogs of any outside breeds) until about 2,000 years ago, when there is evidence that the dogs began interbreeding with breeds from the Near East. The text also indicates that around the same time, the sites began to contain glass beads and other artifacts seeming to be from the Near East, even though there is no evidence that the people of those sites traveled widely outside Siberia. Because there is evidence of Near East dog breeds and Near East artifacts at Siberian sites beginning about 2,000 years ago but no evidence of the people\u2019s travel to the Near East around that time, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that Feuerborn and colleagues concluded that dogs and artifacts like glass beads were transported to Siberia from the Near East, starting around 2,000 years ago.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text explicitly states that there is no evidence that the people of the Siberian sites 2,000 years ago traveled extensively beyond Siberia, which they would\u2019ve had to do to reach the Near East; therefore, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to conclude that the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads suggests that people from Siberia began arriving in the Near East around 2,000 years ago. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds (and evidence of interbreeding with Siberian dogs) and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time. The text doesn\u2019t suggest the purpose of the arrival of the Near East dogs and artifacts or give any indication of Siberian dog breeds being transported elsewhere through trade. Choice D is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time; it doesn\u2019t suggest the purpose of this arrival and makes no mention of Siberian glass beads or other artifacts of Siberian origin."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah\u2019s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic\u2014namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average\u2014which implies faster travel times between package destinations\u2014would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn\u2019t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections\u2014both with and without dedicated left-turn signals\u2014would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn\u2019t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn\u2019t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn\u2019t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher\u2019s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times."

Plants in the fynbos have uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil. Ecologists transplanted tree seedlings from the forest into plots in the fynbos. Seedlings in plots isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate five times greater than that of the seedlings in plots in close proximity to the roots of fynbos plants.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "Fynbos roots damage the root systems of forest plants, leaving those plants unable to acquire sufficient nutrients.",

      "The root systems of fynbos plants enhance the soil immediately surrounding the plants, allowing them to thrive in an otherwise harsh habitat."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with the Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have \"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" The text then describes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate five times greater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to such an extent that forest plants can\u2019t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any significant \"transition space\" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having \"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" This description establishes that fynbos roots are specialized for efficient nutrient absorption. The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings \"isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate five times greater\" than those near fynbos roots. This result demonstrates that when forest seedlings don\u2019t have to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos roots, they grow much better. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afro-temperate forest are distinct from, and adjacent to, each other and that there is \"almost no transition space\" (area of mixed fynbos and forest plants), the experiment shows that forest plants can grow in soil occupied by fynbos roots, just not very well. So, the idea that the fynbos roots physically obstruct forest plants is unsupported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text\u2019s claim that fynbos roots absorb nutrients from, and therefore deplete, the soil they\u2019re in, and furthermore, nothing in the text suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh in general."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the group to continue sharing a room. The phrase \"Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command\" explicitly shows her making a determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty\u2019s specific tactics: she \"dwelt touchingly upon their long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated.\" These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully crafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group\u2019s rooming situation.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about the events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty\u2019s efforts to be persuasive during such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent\u2019s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship between her \"sense of humour\" and her \"sense of justice.\" While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty\u2019s situation, the quotation doesn\u2019t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the topic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty\u2019s efforts during a conversation to convince Mrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation suggests that Patty can be assertive (she abruptly grabbed her friends and \"shoved them into the empty schoolroom\"), it doesn\u2019t show Patty asserting herself by trying to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the proposed rooming arrangements.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of Ancestral Puebloans\u2019 migration to the Rio Grande Valley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices\u2014including the farming of turkeys\u2014to their new home.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley\u2019s terrain to that of Mesa Verde\u2019s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this finding doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region\u2014the Rio Grande Valley\u2014after 1280."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion. The text explains that, according to some climate models, precipitation in the western United States will become concentrated into fewer, more intense rain and snow events. According to the text, Persad and her colleagues concluded that more irrigation will consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to, or greatly affected by, the baseline concentration of precipitation in an area. This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers\u2019 simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios\u2014one in which an area\u2019s annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more\u20149.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater. This difference illustrates the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will vary greatly depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it compares changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation to changes in the amount of water entering aquifers. Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion doesn\u2019t focus on changes to the amount of water entering aquifers; rather, the researchers\u2019 conclusion focuses on changes to irrigation output relative to how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area is. Choice C is incorrect because it supports only part of Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion. According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area\u2019s baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers\u2019 conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice D is incorrect because data in the table indicate no declines in water use for irrigation, showing only increases in the form of positive values."

According to the text, the object was created between 1 and 250 CE. The text then mentions a researcher who comments on the runestone\u2019s significance to the study of runic alphabets. Thus, the main focus throughout the text is a runestone found in Norway.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text mentions the Iron Age only to indicate the era when the runestone was created and when runic alphabets were in use; there\u2019s no discussion of battles during this era. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions the carbon dating method just once and does so only to indicate the age of the runestone; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that this method is new.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Shultz\u2019s finding about male tanagers. The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually \u201can honest signal\u201d (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven\u2019t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren\u2019t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager\u2019s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird\u2019s overall fitness.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Shultz\u2019s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because Shultz\u2019s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers\u2019 feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it\u2019s true, regardless of whether it\u2019s actually true. Since there\u2019s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there\u2019s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because Shultz\u2019s finding suggests that certain male tanagers may appear to be fitter than they actually are, not that scientists haven\u2019t determined why tanagers prefer mates with colorful appearances."

Waweru believed the pits could have been used as game boards to play ancient versions of mancala, a two-person strategy game that is still popular today.

The text begins by discussing Waweru\u2019s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru \"noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone,\" this observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don\u2019t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn\u2019t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any variation in the depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn\u2019t indicate that the depth of the pits factored into Waweru\u2019s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala."

Although according to the graph it\u2019s true that none of the group\u2019s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups\u2019 average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn\u2019t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility.

The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language.

Instead, it indicates that surfactants are frequently used to manufacture microplastics and that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss how microplastics can be removed from the ocean. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released into the ocean from microplastics and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that surfactants can be used to contain microplastics within certain areas of the ocean.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the second research team\u2019s hypothesis about how a fish\u2019s head shape affects the fish\u2019s ability to detect obstructions. The text explains that fish detect obstructions using water vortices and that testing by Yanagisuru, Akanyeti, and Liao showed that fish with wide heads struggle to distinguish medium-sized vortices from general turbulence in the water. Based on this finding, a second research team hypothesized that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed fish would be less effective at detecting obstructions than narrower-headed fish. The finding that wider-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into obstructions more often than narrower-headed dusky smooth-hound fish did under the specified conditions (low visibility with medium-sized vortices) would directly support the second team\u2019s hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it would provide only partial support for the second research team\u2019s hypothesis. While this finding shows that wide-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into many obstructions, it provides no comparison with narrow-headed fish. The hypothesis specifically predicts a difference in detection ability between fish with wider heads and those with narrower heads, so supporting evidence would need to include data from both head types to allow for this comparison. Choice B is incorrect because it would not support the second research team\u2019s hypothesis comparing obstruction detection between fish with wide heads and those with narrow heads. Instead, it examines variation within a single narrow-headed species, which would not address the hypothesis about differences between fish with wider and narrower head shapes. Choice D is incorrect because this finding would contradict rather than support the second research team\u2019s hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that wider-headed fish will be less likely to detect obstructions than narrower-headed fish in low-visibility conditions, which would result in wider-headed fish bumping into obstructions more frequently. A finding showing equal bumping rates between fish with the two head shapes would indicate no relationship between head width and detection ability, directly contradicting the hypothesis."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of the study by Versace and colleagues. The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they\u2019re social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues\u2019 experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren\u2019t social and don\u2019t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn\u2019t social and doesn\u2019t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn\u2019t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don\u2019t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can\u2019t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren\u2019t social and don\u2019t practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises\u2019 responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the two types of stick tools used by New Caledonian crows. The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don\u2019t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools\u2014but not the tools without hooks\u2014in their grasp or in safe places when they aren\u2019t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren\u2019t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they\u2019re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren\u2019t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there\u2019s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation to illustrate the claim that Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as \u201cboth extremely virtuous and unforgiving.\u201d In the quotation, a man describes Lady Chiltern as someone who \u201cdoes not know what weakness or temptation is.\u201d In other words, the man regards her as someone who is strong and adheres to a strict definition of moral perfection. However, he ironically suggests that this definition excludes mercy and forgiveness\u2014qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is \u201cpitiless in her perfection\u2014cold and stern and without mercy.\u201d This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as \u201ca woman of the very highest principles.\u201d However, it doesn\u2019t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn\u2019t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t address either Lady Chiltern\u2019s perceived virtuousness or her perceived lack of forgiveness; instead, it expresses the belief that she is sensible."

According to the text, some scientists believe that a comet fragment hitting Earth caused the cooling of the Younger Dryas period to come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a crater in Greenland, which some believe supports the theory of a comet fragment hitting Earth to initiate the Younger Dryas. However, the text also notes that the team was unable to determine the age of the crater. If the age of the crater can\u2019t be determined, then its connection to the Younger Dryas period of time can\u2019t be confirmed either. Thus, it can\u2019t be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because though the text suggests that the age of the comet crater found by a team of scientists is uncertain, it doesn\u2019t address whether a comet fragment can make a crater as large as 19 miles wide. The text doesn\u2019t consider the size of comet fragments and how they relate to the size of craters they might make. Choice C is incorrect because the debate in the text centers on the age of the crater found, not the cause of the crater. The text doesn\u2019t indicate uncertainty about what caused the discovered crater. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that the age of the crater found by the team of scientists is uncertain, not that the dates of the Younger Dryas are uncertain or incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text about the effect of messaging on participative pricing. The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn\u2019t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it\u2019s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants\u2019 valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets\u2019 actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study."

The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Allen\u2019s claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions more easily understood by any particular group of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen\u2019s claim that judicial opinions could be strengthened by the inclusion of discussions of philosophers whose views disagree with those of the judges authoring the opinions.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text presents Allen\u2019s argument that discussing philosophers whose views judges disagree with could strengthen judicial opinions, not that doing so could bring those opinions into line with views that are popular among philosophers."

    "prompt": "Gorgets, or necklaces with large pendants, have been part of the ceremonial attire of tribes from the US Southeast for centuries. One of the oldest examples, the Fairfield Gorget, was found in Fairfield, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900\u20131600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar\u2014a species whose range doesn\u2019t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species\u2019 range. Therefore, some scholars argue that long-distance trade in Mexican art objects brought the imagery to Missouri, where a local artist could have adopted it and incorporated it into the Fairfield Gorget.",
    "question_text": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "The Fairfield Gorget is dated not to the Mississippian period but instead to the earlier Woodland period, which ended around 900 CE.",
      "The range of the jaguar is shown to have expanded dramatically after the Mississippian period came to a close around 1600 CE.",
      "An ancient Mexican art object is found at a site that dates to the Mississippian period and is close to where the Fairfield Gorget was found.",
      "Certain works by present-day artists from Southeastern tribes reflect outside cultural influences, including contemporary Mexican art."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it\u2019s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar\u2019s range didn\u2019t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget\u2019s artist likely wouldn\u2019t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar\u2019s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget\u2019s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic influence and exchange."

Rather than addressing the idea that the individuals likely had higher outputs than those presented in the table, this choice simply compares data from the table to make the point that Dark Cloud has fewer credited acting roles than Lillian St. Cyr (35 and 66, respectively). Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents data from the table, even though it may exemplify the idea that the film outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums by implying that Edwin Carewe acted in more than 47 films. The table indicates that Edwin Carewe was active from 1912 to 1934, meaning that his 47 credited acting roles were in films made before or during 1934, not after that time.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes\u2019 antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team\u2019s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes\u2019 antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a point that Prospero makes about Miranda. The text begins with Miranda responding to Prospero\u2019s claim that she probably doesn\u2019t remember her life before the island. She describes a distant memory, asking if she had \"four or five women\" caring for her. Prospero confirms this (\"thou hadst\") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (\"ought ere thou camest here\"), she might also remember arriving on the island (\"how thou camest here\"). That is, Prospero indicates that Miranda\u2019s ability to summon details of an experience from before her arrival on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Prospero doesn\u2019t say anything about how Miranda presents her early childhood memory of having several people care for her\u2014he indicates only his surprise that she remembers something from so long ago (\"the dark backward and abysm of time\") and his thought that she may also be able to recall another childhood event: her arrival on the island. Further, Prospero doesn\u2019t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as \"like a dream\" she can\u2019t be certain of, Prospero doesn\u2019t mention her uncertainty\u2014though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (\"abysm of time\"). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is \"rather like a dream\" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn\u2019t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream. Instead, he confirms that what Miranda remembers actually happened, answering her question about having had caregivers with \"thou hadst,\" and asks her what else she can remember from long ago."

Karla A. Camacho-Cruz and colleagues assessed delta 15-N values in the seagrass Thalassia testudinum from sites on Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula with intermediate tourism development, including Akumal Bay and Tulum, and low tourism development, including Mahahual and Xahuayxol, throughout 2016 and 2017.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion. The text accompanying the table states that delta 15-N values (a measure of the ratio of two nitrogen isotopes) can be used as an indirect means of measuring the ratio of human wastewater to water from uncontaminated sources\u2014the higher the delta 15-N values, the greater the presence of human wastewater. The text goes on to mention an experiment conducted by Camacho-Cruz and colleagues measuring delta 15-N values in seagrass on the Yucatan peninsula at several sites, four of which are presented in the table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had intermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable to infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are subject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and colleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the two intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably\u2014both had higher delta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in February 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-tourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the conclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal Bay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta 15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at Akumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that delta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened intermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human wastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends in the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017, and in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017)."

      "researchers need to evaluate whether other minerals like perovskite are as effective as perovskite seems to be."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the efficiency of various photovoltaic cells. The text indicates that Miranda-P\u00e9rez and her team found that adding a layer of perovskite to silicon-based cells increased the percentage of sunlight converted to usable electricity relative to the percentage converted to electricity by silicon-based cells. Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in efficiency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%\u201322% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less\u2014not more than 29.5%\u2014of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a detail that, if true, would most directly support the researcher\u2019s claim about the difficulty of determining olive tree age by ring counting. The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark rings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree\u2019s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that are difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or impossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher\u2019s claim that the ring-counting method often can\u2019t be used for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn\u2019t explain why counting rings wouldn\u2019t work for determining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn\u2019t pose an insurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher\u2019s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method for olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the claim that counting rings often can\u2019t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly spaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher\u2019s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive trees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even narrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because the ideal climate conditions for olive trees don\u2019t explain why counting rings wouldn\u2019t work as a method for determining their age. While growing conditions might affect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that olive trees thrive in hot, dry environments doesn\u2019t directly address why the conventional method of counting rings would be ineffective for determining their age."

The archaeologists found that the red pigment on some of the beads contained no iron but had a high level of carbon. Since red ocher gets its color from iron oxide, while plant-based pigments have a high level of carbon, the researchers concluded that the Natufian beadmakers used plant-based pigments to decorate some of the beads examined in the study.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate that the Natufians were the first to use plant-based pigments, so it cannot be concluded that the beads in the study were the oldest surviving examples of the use of plant-based pigments for decorating beads. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not compare the brightness of plant-based and mineral-based pigments. Choice D is incorrect. While it can be concluded that the Natufian beadmakers used plant-based pigments because the pigment found on several beads had a high level of carbon, the text offers no evidence that ocher was difficult to find."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists\u2019 claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program\u2019s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists\u2019 claim about the program\u2019s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program\u2019s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well."

The text also explains that melanosomes have different shapes depending on the colors they produce. Given this information, it follows that the scientists hypothesized that they could determine the colors of the extinct bird by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the feather.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to show how melanosomes can be found in fossils belonging to animals from other extinct species. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird\u2019s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird\u2019s fossilized feather.

Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests only one method of identifying the colors of extinct animals: by examining the shapes of melanosomes found in fossils.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Jan Packer and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about the effect of leave time on the attentiveness of university employees. According to the text, the researchers\u2019 study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2\u20134 days of leave, and a group who took 1\u20135 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2\u20134 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1\u20135 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2\u20134 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1\u20135 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2\u20134 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1\u20135 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers\u2019 conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2\u20134 days of leave with those who took 1\u20135 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2\u20134 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1\u20135 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers\u2019 conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2\u20134 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers\u2019 conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion."

The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher\u2019s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn\u2019t sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn\u2019t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals\u2019 torpor bouts compared.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn\u2019t sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels."

The text makes this claim based on the fact that ancient trade routes connected Puerto Rico with Colombia but not with Peru. However, if it\u2019s true that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were genetically less similar to ancient guinea pigs in Colombia than to ancient guinea pigs in Peru, this would suggest that the Puerto Rican guinea pigs didn\u2019t descend from Colombian guinea pigs. Instead, Puerto Rican guinea pigs\u2019 greater genetic similarity to Peruvian guinea pigs implies that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were likely brought to the island from Peru, despite the lack of direct ancient trade routes between the two regions.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. While a finding about how common guinea pig imagery is in ancient Puerto Rican art would indicate the cultural significance of guinea pigs, it wouldn\u2019t be relevant to a claim about the geographical origin or descent of the guinea pig population on the island. The guinea pigs depicted in the artwork could have descended from guinea pigs in either Colombia or Peru; therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that guinea pigs in Puerto Rico probably came from Colombia and descended from Colombian guinea pigs. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that modern breeds of guinea pigs don\u2019t look like images of guinea pigs in ancient art from Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Peru wouldn\u2019t address the ancestral relationships between ancient guinea pig populations in these three regions.

Choice D is incorrect because a finding about the population sizes of guinea pigs in ancient Colombia and ancient Peru wouldn\u2019t be relevant to a claim about which population the Puerto Rican guinea pigs likely descended from.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it describes an experimental outcome that would most directly weaken the student\u2019s hypothesis. According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benefit more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modification being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were \u201csignificantly taller\u201d than those in the more acidic mixture\u2014an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneficial to the plants\u2019 growth.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen the student\u2019s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student\u2019s hypothesis that acidic soil benefits choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student\u2019s hypothesis that choy sum benefits from acidic soil."

    "prompt": "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua is the first object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational influence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from \u2018Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body.",

      "Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that could be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to \u2018Oumuamua.",
      "Exposure to interstellar cosmic radiation can result in the formation of embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice; moreover, when traveling through the solar system, \u2018Oumuamua experienced warming sufficient to alter its icy structure and allow for outgassing."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents findings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named \u2018Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within \u2018Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: \u2018Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues\u2019 claim.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from \u2018Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner\u2019s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to \u2018Oumuamua, but the text states that \u2018Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available."

The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it \"creeps in unperceived,\" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle\u2019s observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn\u2019t directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle\u2019s point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn\u2019t address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations."

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers\u2019 conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn\u2019t support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it\u2019s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don\u2019t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn\u2019t support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it\u2019s extreme.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it\u2019s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn\u2019t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn\u2019t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn\u2019t advantageous.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Sumerian civilization and crop growth. The text mentions the hot, sunny weather in the area where the Sumerians lived, which made crops grow quickly but also made it difficult to keep them alive. The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming\u2014as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to find something to do with the surplus crops\u2014that is, they stored the extra crops for later use.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t logically follow that a surplus in crops would lead the Sumerians to choose only certain days of the season to harvest. Nor is there any indication in the text that the Sumerians improved their farming methods with the goal of reducing the time spent farming. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn\u2019t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn\u2019t supported by the text."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of competing claims about the origins of red velvet cake. The text states that the origins of the recipe for red velvet cake \"are unclear.\" The text then presents four different entities that claim to have created the first red velvet cake recipe: a Dallas bakery (1860s), the Adams Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian department store (1930s). Lastly, the text states that \"no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others.\" Given this information, it most logically follows that it\u2019s not possible to determine who baked the first red velvet cake, as there is insufficient evidence to determine which claim, if any, is correct.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t provide information indicating that red velvet cake existed before the 1860s. According to the text, the earliest claim for creating red velvet cake comes from a bakery in Dallas, Texas, that asserted it developed the first recipe for the cake at the time of the bakery\u2019s opening in the 1860s. There\u2019s no textual support for the conclusion that the cake existed before this earliest claimed date, since the text presents only competing claims starting from the 1860s and extending to the 1930s without evidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t support the conclusion that none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake likely invented the cake. The text states that multiple entities claim to have invented the recipe and that \"no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others.\" This lack of decisive evidence doesn\u2019t logically lead to the conclusion that all the claims are false; it merely indicates that the cake\u2019s true origins can\u2019t be determined with the available evidence. The text leaves open the possibility that one of the claimants could indeed be the actual inventor. Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no basis for concluding that the Dallas bakery is \"probably\" the inventor of red velvet cake. While the text mentions that this bakery claims to have created the recipe in the 1860s (making it the earliest claim), the text explicitly states that there\u2019s no definitive evidence supporting any of the claims about the cake\u2019s origins over the others. The text presents all claims as equally lacking in definitive supporting evidence."

The text explains that the Cantares Mexicanos contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers\u2019 unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain\u2019s. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some of the poems make \u201cinarguable references\u201d to common Spanish customs, which conflicts with the idea that these references can reasonably be attributed to mere coincidence."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of aptamers\u2019 capacity to test for pathogens in food. The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn\u2019t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen E. coli O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other E. coli strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for E. coli, and similarity between strains (of E. coli or of other pathogens) isn\u2019t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of E. coli, since Somvanshi et al.\u2019s paper turned purple when exposed to E. coli O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn\u2019t bind to different strains of E. coli. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of E. coli (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of E. coli. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low."

It\u2019s logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them\u2014specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there\u2019s no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn\u2019t always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it\u2019s true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the scientists\u2019 conclusion has anything to do with shyness.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement about copper mining. The table shows the amount of copper mined in each of four countries in 1995 and 2020. According to the text, a student who consults the table notes that the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020 had mined a different amount in 1995. The table indicates that Kazakhstan is the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020 and 0.26 million metric tons of copper in 1995.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020. According to the table, Canada mined 0.73 million metric tons of copper in 1995 and 0.59 million metric tons in 2020. It didn\u2019t mine 0.55 million metric tons in either year. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020. According to the table, Indonesia mined 0.44 million metric tons of copper in 1995 and 0.51 million metric tons in 2020. It didn\u2019t mine 0.55 million metric tons in either year. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020.

The Galleria dell\u2019Accademia also offers virtual tours that art lovers can view online for free.

      "Many surveyed visitors to the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia indicated that they would likely view the virtual tours in order to reminisce about their in-person visit."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the museum administrators\u2019 claim that concerns about virtual tours replacing in-person visits were unjustified. The text explains that after the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia began offering online tours, there were concerns that if people viewed these virtual tours, they would consider an in-person visit to be unnecessary. The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the virtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-person visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators\u2019 claim that the initial concerns were unfounded.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person visit wouldn\u2019t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits. This finding would only indicate that these particular visitors didn\u2019t have the opportunity to be influenced by virtual tours when making their decision to visit. Choice C is incorrect because the geographic location of visitors wouldn\u2019t address the impact of virtual tours on people\u2019s decisions to visit the museum in person. Whether visitors live in Florence or elsewhere would suggest nothing about whether virtual tours influenced their choice. This information is irrelevant to the administrators\u2019 claim about the relationship between virtual tours and in-person visits. Choice D is incorrect because visitors\u2019 intentions to view virtual tours after their in-person visit wouldn\u2019t address the initial concerns that virtual tours might make in-person visits seem unnecessary. This finding indicates that some visitors plan to use virtual tours as a way to remember their visit, but it provides no information about whether virtual tours influenced their decision to visit in person in the first place, which is what the administrators\u2019 claim addresses."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of English dialects spoken in Scotland and the Upland South. The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the \"r\" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were influenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed\u2014that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn\u2019t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been influenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers\u2019 ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the \"r\" sound from those ancestors\u2019 dialects\u2014not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound is part of English dialects spoken in the Upland South today, which almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be the case if people from Scotland, who were the main colonizers of the Upland South, had eliminated that linguistic feature from their dialects."

This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and Paris), showing significant differences between guilds relative to population in these cities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Bordeaux had 80,000 inhabitants, according to the table, while Lyon had 143,000, so it isn\u2019t correct to say that they had \"nearly equal numbers of inhabitants.\" Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Although Lyon did have fewer inhabitants than Paris, it didn\u2019t have more guilds\u2014Paris had 133 guilds versus Lyon\u2019s 72. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t support the claim.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that two languages can convey similar amounts of information even if they\u2019re spoken at different rates. The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it isn\u2019t true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the five languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn\u2019t support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they\u2019re spoken at different rates.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because it isn\u2019t true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they\u2019re spoken at different rates.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it isn\u2019t true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

When Thornton\u2019s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting.",
    "question_text": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "Buck has become less social since he began living with Thornton.",
      "Buck mistrusts humans and does his best to avoid them.",
      "Buck has been especially well liked by most of Thornton\u2019s friends.",
      "Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any other person."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. After establishing that Buck views most people \u201cas nothing,\u201d the text explains that Buck won\u2019t acknowledge people other than Thornton unless they appear friendly toward Thornton, and even then he\u2019s only reluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornton has a special status in Buck\u2019s mind, with Buck holding him in higher regard than other people.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck isn\u2019t social with people other than Thornton but doesn\u2019t address Buck\u2019s life or temperament before he lived with Thornton. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck doesn\u2019t really care about people other than Thornton and is aloof toward them. However, there\u2019s no indication that Buck mistrusts and avoids people generally; indeed, he accepts Thornton, who is a human. Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to random travelers praising and petting Buck and Thornton\u2019s partners giving Buck favors, but there\u2019s no indication that any of these people are Thornton\u2019s friends or that they have a particular fondness for Buck."

One of the most significant sources, Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History of the Kings of Britain, was written in the 1130s; some material from it was later adapted by the Norman poet Wace into the Roman de Brut in 1155.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Arthurian legends. The text establishes a chronology of Arthurian sources, with Vita Sancti Cadoci composed in the 11th century (the 1000s), Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History written in the 1130s, Wace\u2019s Roman de Brut in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen in the second half of the 12th century (1150\u20131200). Importantly, the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffrey\u2019s History, Wace added \"the famous Round Table\" to it. If Wace introduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element was not present in earlier works. This suggests that the Arthurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci, which was written before both Geoffrey\u2019s and Wace\u2019s works, would not have featured the Round Table.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses several works that include legends about a character, King Arthur, but doesn\u2019t address the historical accuracy of the stories in those works or suggest that the creation of Culhwch and Olwen was relevant to any other works\u2019 accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that works containing stories of the Round Table were available to Geoffrey of Monmouth when he composed his History in the 1130s, whether he was aware of them or not; it instead suggests that the idea of the Round Table wasn\u2019t introduced until more than a decade later, when Wace added it to Geoffrey\u2019s History. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the Arthurian legends in Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History differ from those in Wace\u2019s Roman de Brut in that Wace added the idea of the Round Table, the text doesn\u2019t compare the overall content of the Arthurian legends in the two works and doesn\u2019t indicate anything about the overall content of the legends in Culhwch and Olwen."

In his 1950 masterpiece History of Mexico, Medell\u00edn fuses these influences into a style so idiosyncratic that it resists efforts to view his work through the lens of nationality or cultural identity.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually \u201cinvites classification as Indigenous art.\u201d Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn\u2019t push back on Medell\u00edn\u2019s \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can\u2019t be defined by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous influences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the influences equally\u2014that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses."

Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016."

The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female figure who is fishing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female figure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of fishing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female figure engaged in fishing does not indicate with certainty that the figure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with fishing, and the figure might be anyone at all).\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted fishing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female figure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain\u2019s proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female figure, and so the possibility that the figure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be definitively eliminated. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the only reasonable way to interpret the figure is as Venus."

We\u2019re also told that, while \u201crelatively few people paid the tax on real estate,\u201d real estate taxes were both the main way people qualified to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had significant French real estate holdings.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The passage doesn\u2019t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there\u2019s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don\u2019t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don\u2019t have enough information to determine if those with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it\u2019s possible that those with significant foreign investments were likely to also be people with significant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don\u2019t have the information necessary to make this inference."

A crowd has gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden, an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.\n\nOne man, who was more excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) \u201cWho roar for the Sub-Warden?\u201d Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting \u201cBread!\u201d and some \u201cTaxes!\u201d, but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted.\n\nAll this I saw from the open window of the Warden\u2019s breakfast-saloon, looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.\n\n\u201cWhat can it all mean?\u201d he kept repeating to himself. \u201cI never heard such shouting before\u2014and at this time of the morning, too!

The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet. This discovery was surprising to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes would originate from all over the planet because of the cooling of the planet\u2019s surface. Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma flows deep beneath the planet\u2019s surface that trigger the marsquakes.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is supported by the text. The text states that the marsquakes described in the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander originated from the same location on Mars. The text goes on to say that because they had expected the opposite (that marsquakes would originate from all over the planet) this discovery surprised the scientists.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t say that the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander revealed any surprising information about the planet\u2019s surface temperature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars\u2019s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temperature has been falling rather than rising. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that by studying seismic activity scientists found a possible explanation for what causes marsquakes, the text doesn\u2019t say that they discovered that marsquakes are caused by different types of seismic waves. Rather, the text states that based on the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander, scientists now believe that this seismic activity happens because of areas of active magma that flow below the planet\u2019s surface. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the amount of data NASA\u2019s InSight lander collected or whether scientists who studied the data found the amount to be as expected. Instead, the text focuses on what the data revealed about where on Mars the marsquakes originated."

The text states that researchers have used fossils to learn about the nervous systems of ancient arthropods. It then provides a specific example of researchers studying fossils of Mollisonia symmetrica and finding evidence of a nerve cord and possibly a synganglion (a brain-like mass of nerves). The text concludes by noting that researchers hope to discover more features of prehistoric arthropods\u2019 nervous systems \"as additional fossils are found.\" Thus, the main idea of the text is that fossil evidence can contribute to the understanding of the nervous system in ancient arthropods.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t compare the brains of hawk moths and brine shrimp. These animals are merely mentioned as examples of arthropods in the opening sentence, and the text doesn\u2019t go on to discuss any similarities between their brains. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses nervous systems, not spines, in ancient arthropods, and it doesn\u2019t specifically mention findings about ancient hawk moths or brine shrimp. Choice D is incorrect. While the text concludes by noting that researchers aim to discover additional characteristics of prehistoric arthropods\u2019 nervous systems as more fossils are uncovered, this statement doesn\u2019t suggest that researchers need to focus on finding more fossils. Rather, it simply indicates that researchers expect to learn more about this topic as additional fossils are discovered. Moreover, the statement is just a detail that supports the main idea; it\u2019s not the main idea itself."

Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something.",

This choice doesn\u2019t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t weaken the underlined claim.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of patterns of linguistic distribution in New York City. The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their region of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south China (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional language distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan). Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate themselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss rates of language change. The text indicates that many languages are spoken in New York City, but it doesn\u2019t provide any information about how quickly these languages might be changing, either in relation to each other or compared to areas where fewer languages are spoken. Choice B is incorrect because the text provides no information about changes in vocabulary or pronunciation of immigrant languages compared to their original forms.

Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t provide any information about a relationship between a country\u2019s physical size and the number of languages spoken there. While the text mentions that over 600 languages are spoken in New York City, it doesn\u2019t relate this to the physical size of New York or the United States, nor does it suggest that large countries like China have more languages than geographically smaller countries."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. The speaker describes an evening scene observed from a boat: \"little lights in little ports come out\" and are reflected in the water\u2019s surface \"with the stars,\" fishing boats are moored, \"sails are furled\" (rolled up), and the riding-light is shining. The speaker emphasizes the calmness of the scene, noting that the \"race of wind is stilled\" and the atmosphere is sleepy (\"slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world\"), and then indicates that the calmness prompts thoughts of how old age might be \"sweet\" and \"quiet\" and \"gracious in retreat\" after \"a windy youth\" with \"storms.\" Thus, the main idea is that the tranquility of a port in the evening can lead a person to appreciate the potential stillness of old age.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the speaker isn\u2019t discussing the difficulty of bringing a ship into port but describing the calmness of the port at night. And rather than suggesting that old age involves struggles, the speaker suggests that after \"a windy youth\" with \"storms\" to be weathered, old age will be \"sweet,\" \"quiet,\" and \"gracious\"\u2014that is, old age will be tranquil like a port at night. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker isn\u2019t suggesting that a person who has lived a varied and active life might find it difficult to stay in a calm place in old age. On the contrary, the speaker suggests that after a \"windy youth\" with \"storms,\" old age can be welcomed as something \"sweet,\" \"quiet,\" and \"gracious,\" just like a calm port at night. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker does touch on the idea of a \"windy youth\" followed by \"sweet old age,\" the speaker doesn\u2019t tie that idea to a contrast between daytime activity and nighttime peacefulness at a port. The speaker doesn\u2019t address any activity during the day at a port, only briefly mentioning that the \"race of wind is stilled\" at the end of the day, and instead focuses on the tranquility of the port at night and how it prompts thoughts of \"quiet\" and \"gracious\" old age."

      "defense against A. sicerae is strongest when both DptA and DptB are present."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on supporting data in the graph. The text indicates that in the fly D. melanogaster, DptA and DptB are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested D. melanogaster\u2019s resistance to P. rettgeri and A. sicerae bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: DptA silenced (referred to as type A), DptB silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but not with DptB activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to P. rettgeri). The graph shows the post\u2013A. sicerae infection results, which indicate that DptB activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas DptA activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when DptA activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when DptB activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with DptA activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that DptB may have developed as a specific defense against A. sicerae.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that DptA activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where DptA alone was silenced, DptB alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both DptA and DptB, which would be necessary to determine whether DptA conferred defense against A. sicerae in the presence of DptB. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: P. rettgeri and A. sicerae. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in DptA is associated with resistance to P. rettgeri while DptB activity is not, and that DptB activity is associated with resistance to A. sicerae while DptA is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both DptA and DptB. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of DptA and DptB silenced, or inactive."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers\u2019 claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers\u2019 claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they\u2019ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn\u2019t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers\u2019 claim is based on a fact\u2014that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space\u2014which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn\u2019t weaken a claim that\u2019s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form."

The text explains that fashion retailers face challenges in forecasting product demand due to rapidly changing tastes and lengthy manufacturing times. It then presents research by Fu and Fisher showing that combining retailers\u2019 own data with social media information significantly improves forecast accuracy. The text concludes by noting that better predictions help retailers meet demand without becoming overstocked. Thus, the main idea is that using multiple data sources (retailers\u2019 own data combined with social media information) can enhance fashion retailers\u2019 ability to anticipate demand.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t claim that social media is revolutionizing, or fundamentally changing, how sellers and researchers view the fashion industry. The text never addresses the way the fashion industry is viewed; rather, it discusses a practical approach sellers in the industry can take to better match production with demand. Choice C is incorrect. Although avoiding overstocking is mentioned as a benefit of an approach that can help fashion sellers better predict demand, the text doesn\u2019t focus on overstocking or characterize it as the main concern of sellers. Rather, the text is focused on discussing the approach itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that fashion sellers encounter obstacles when using their own data to try to forecast demand as tastes and styles change; the text focuses on the idea that instead of using their own data alone, retailers should combine their own data with social media information to more accurately forecast demand."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the text\u2019s conclusion about the results of the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21. According to the text, Sevilla and Townsend found in several experiments that when products in a generic retail setting are displayed with a low product-to-space ratio (that is, with lots of space between them), consumers view those products as significantly more valuable than when the same products are displayed with a higher product-to-space ratio (less space between them). The text then states that the results of an experiment specifically using the contexts of an inexpensive store (Forever 21) and an upscale one (Tiffany & Co.) suggest that an inexpensive store context may moderate, or lessen, that effect. If Sevilla and Townsend found that participants in the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21 judged the same jewelry items as substantially more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.) but judged the same jewelry items as only slightly more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the inexpensive store (Forever 21), that finding would demonstrate that increased space between products was associated with less of an increase in those products\u2019 perceived value at the inexpensive store than at the upscale store. Thus, the finding would support the text\u2019s conclusion that a store context associated with inexpensive goods moderates the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their earlier experiments.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged jewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect the researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or lessens, that effect. Choice C is incorrect because this finding wouldn\u2019t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced close together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests on determining the difference in jewelry items\u2019 perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then comparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a finding that compares perceptions of the jewelry items\u2019 value between the two stores but for only one type of spacing condition at a time wouldn\u2019t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within each type of store context.

Davis\u2019s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey\u2019s and Smith\u2019s songs. The text calls Davis\u2019s transcription process \"labor intensive\" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts.

The text states that while consumers expect ever-faster delivery of goods, delivery companies \"continue to struggle with last-mile logistics.\" The text further explains that innovations aimed at addressing this challenge have a tendency to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed are paired with persistent, complex delivery obstacles and new problems arising from attempted solutions, it logically follows that consumer expectations for delivery times may be exceeding what companies can feasibly provide.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the idea of delivery volumes at all and makes it clear that companies are already aware of and trying to address consumers\u2019 expectations for delivery.

The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conflicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conflict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conflicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs being flawed. Rather, the text states that the conflict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having failed to account for some factor."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from \"The Bet\" to illustrate the claim that the banker was very upset about something. The quotation indicates that the banker shed tears, which suggests that he was likely unhappy about something, and that his emotions were so strong that they kept him from sleeping for hours. These details suggest that the banker was very upset.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation mainly describes the banker cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn\u2019t suggest that he was particularly upset about anything. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t mention whether the banker was experiencing any particularly strong negative feelings; instead, the quotation focuses on the quietness of the setting.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, \u201cEach, coming\u201d\u2014that is, each new year as it comes\u2014\u201cbrings ambitions high.\u201d In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (\u201ceach, departing\u201d), it \u201cleaves a sigh / Linked to the past.\u201d A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases \u201cthe years go swiftly by,\u201d \u201cEach, coming,\u201d and \u201ceach, departing\u201d indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a \u201cbrazen tongue,\u201d a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to \u201cominous stillness,\u201d there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (\u201cmany a squandered day\u201d), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret.

The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s\u2014during most of Morrison\u2019s time working there\u2014than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House\u2019s published authors, thus supporting the scholar\u2019s claim.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the scholar\u2019s claim is about Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company\u2019s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison\u2019s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn\u2019t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar\u2019s claim is about Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison\u2019s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House\u2019s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar\u2019s claim focuses on Morrison\u2019s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House\u2019s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison\u2019s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House."

When communications researcher Sungkyoung Lee and her colleagues tested messages seeking volunteers for clinical trials, however, they found that participants in their study judged recruitment messages from former trial volunteers as significantly more credible than messages from doctors (i.e., credentialed experts). One reason for this may be that the doctors\u2019 status as credentialed experts wasn\u2019t ignored but rather was outweighed by participants\u2019 views of the experiential relevance of the two types of messengers; that is, participants may have reacted the way they did because ______\nblank",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of how participants considered messages from former trial volunteers and doctors. The text first establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, then, that participants regarded the former trial volunteers\u2019 direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors\u2019 status as credentialed experts.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the tone of the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers regarding the clinical trials. Choice B is incorrect. Since the study participants had not themselves participated in the clinical trial, they could not rely on their experience to evaluate the credibility of either the former trial volunteers or the doctors. Choice D is incorrect. While the text does establish that the participants likely considered the messages from both the doctors and the former trial volunteers, it does not suggest that the participants doubted the doctors\u2019 credentials. Rather, the text speculates that participants may have given the experiences of the former trial volunteers more importance than the doctors\u2019 credentials when considering the recruitment messages."

To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks.

      "S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.",
      "quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis\u00a0growth if the crystals are not too thin."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because \u00a0it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher\u2019s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn\u2019t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the moss\u2019s photosynthesis.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn\u2019t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about how Richard Wagner achieved moments of extremely high volume in his operas that is supported by the text. The text states that European composers experimented with volume in their works by increasing the number of musicians in the orchestra and provides the example of Wagner, who \"added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra.\" The text explains that by having more of these instruments playing at the same time, the overall volume of the orchestra could be dramatically increased at key moments in Wagner\u2019s operas.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text never indicates that Wagner moved his operas indoors to achieve moments of extremely high volume, nor does it indicate that his operas were previously performed outdoors. The only technique discussed in the text for achieving extremely high volume is Wagner\u2019s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra. Choice C is incorrect because the text never says that Wagner built or used a specially designed concert hall to increase volume through echoes. The only technique discussed in the text is Wagner\u2019s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra. Choice D is incorrect because the text never mentions any special training for singers related to volume or singing for extended periods. The text\u2019s focus is entirely on the orchestra and how Wagner and other European composers used instruments to experiment with volume in their musical works."

The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber and raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body\u2019s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and \u00c1lvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food\u2019s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn\u2019t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and \u00c1lvarez\u2019s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn\u2019t address the beans\u2019 digestibility."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the role of gift giving among members of guilds in early modern London. According to the text, members of these guilds participated in a culture where giving gifts \"both signaled and conferred social status\"\u2014that is, it indicated people\u2019s social standing and also gave them social standing\u2014and occurred in the forms of both philanthropic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) by large guilds, which much research has focused on, and the gifting of handmade items between craft guild members, which Kilburn-Toppin focuses on. The text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and were \"highly discerning,\" or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one\u2019s status and if craft guild members were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds\u2014between people who had high standards for items they made and for items they received\u2014may have been a way for members to maintain and enhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display and receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the \"highly discerning\" members of craft guilds had to do with the members\u2019 interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting those items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those guilds. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t distinguish between \"ostentatious,\" or very showy, and \"prosaic,\" or ordinary, gifts and because the characterization at the end of the text pertains specifically to the gifting of handmade items indicative of great taste, not prosaic items, between members of craft guilds. And while the text indicates that London\u2019s largest guilds gave philanthropic gifts (donations for humanitarian purposes), it doesn\u2019t indicate whether these gifts would have been considered ostentatious. Choice D is incorrect because the characterization presented at the end of the text pertains specifically to the \"highly discerning\" members of craft guilds giving their handmade items as gifts to one another within the craft guilds; the text doesn\u2019t suggest anything about gifting those items to members of London\u2019s largest guilds or how that might affect status differently from giving them to other craft guild members."

The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and frequencies of various pulsar stars called RRATs. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is defined as the time between consecutive pulses. The table shows that the period of RRAT J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRATs listed in the table. If the period is the time between consecutive pulses, and J0614-03 has the shortest period, then J0614-03 has the shortest amount of time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because according to the table, J0545-03 has a period of 1.074 seconds and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses. Therefore, since J0545-03 and J0121+53 have different periods, they do not have the same amount of time between consecutive pulses. Choice C is incorrect because according to the table, J1654-2335 has a period of 0.545 seconds, which is not the longest period of all the RRATs listed in the table. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and both J0545-03 and J0121+53 have longer periods than J1654-2335, so J1654-2335 does not have the longest time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table. Choice D is incorrect because according to the table, J0103+54 has a period of 0.354 seconds, and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and only J0121+53 has more than one second of time between consecutive pulses, not J0103+54."

Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural women to increase their profits per unit sold.",

      "The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their goods to towns with marketplaces is high but largely independent of the number of goods they bring."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Barboza and Trejos\u2019s claim that rural female entrepreneurs who have received small loans from ALSOL are strategic in selling their goods less frequently than they could, even if it means missing payments. The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don\u2019t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers\u2019 claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold\u2014even if those profits are earned less frequently and don\u2019t support weekly loan payments.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn\u2019t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn\u2019t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors\u2014meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn\u2019t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn\u2019t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale."

The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that St\u00f6ger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low-pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support St\u00f6ger and her team\u2019s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on St\u00f6ger and her team\u2019s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, St\u00f6ger and her team\u2019s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because finding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support St\u00f6ger and her team\u2019s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support St\u00f6ger and her team\u2019s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a finding that some other animals in zoos also hum."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the sediments found at the Gale Crater\u2019s Murray Formation on Mars. The text states that data gathered by the Curiosity rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars\u2019s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) was present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn\u2019t support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time. The abundance of fine grains suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) was present for an extended time, not just a short time, and the sections of coarse grains suggest that one or more streams (bodies of flowing water) were intermittently present while the lake existed, not at a separate time. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but did occasionally dry out."

The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model\u2019s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models.

The text goes on to say that many other art organizations support new artists in similar ways, suggesting that these organizations recognize the importance of providing opportunities for young artists to learn from mentors who are established in their field.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that technical training is more beneficial than creative guidance. The text states that AACM mentors offer both technical training and creative guidance to young artists and that other arts organizations offer similar kinds of support; however, nothing in the text suggests that young artists, or artists of any age, benefit more from technical training. Choice C is incorrect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established artists are mentoring young artists through AACM and other arts organizations. The text states that young musicians benefit from AACM mentors but does not address what mentors gain from the relationship, so there is no reason to conclude that most established artists could improve as artists by serving as mentors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that mentors are beneficial to young musicians and that young people pursuing other kinds of art (including painting and writing) can also find mentors through arts organizations, the text gives no indication that mentors are more important for musicians than for other types of artists."

      "the current process of making violins is the same process that was used centuries ago by Cremonese craftspeople."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the sound quality of Cremonese and modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin\u2019s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to \u201cnew analysis,\u201d which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood."

As used in this context, \"transformed\" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (\"radically altered\") the semiconductor industry, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the invention \"overwhelmed\" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention\u2019s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit \"bypassed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

The text first notes that maple trees already thrive in a wide variety of climates and then goes on to say that alterations maples may undergo are likely to be relatively small and easily achieved. This context supports the idea that maple trees will more easily adjust or adapt to a changing climate.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses how maple trees adjust to change, the trees do not \"relocate from,\" or physically move from one place to another. Choice B is incorrect because \"refer to\" means to mention or allude to something, and the trees are not doing either of these actions.

Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although \u201csingular\u201d has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201csingular\u201d means extraordinary, not acceptable.

Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"unified vision\" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the \"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. \"Proficient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they\u2019re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it\u2019s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a \"unified vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others)."

The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film\u2019s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films\u2019 unique stories and aren\u2019t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience\u2019s reactions to characters in animated films."

The text focuses on drivers who feel that a current toll is too high, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that those drivers would be unlikely to be angered by a proposal for the toll to be increased; indeed, drivers who think the toll is already too high likely would be angered by a move to raise it even higher. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"cited in\" would mean referred to or mentioned in something. Although it\u2019s reasonable to suggest that a proposal to raise a toll might not make any mention of drivers who think the toll is already too high, the text focuses on how those drivers and other people are likely to react to arguments in favor of the proposal, not on whether those drivers would be cited in the proposal itself."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, \u201csurmised\u201d means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians \u201cassumed\u201d that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In this context, \u201ccontrived\u201d would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn\u2019t supported by the available data.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it\u2019s Logan and not the economic historians who \u201cquestioned,\u201d or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \u201cregretted,\u201d or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians\u2019 emotional response to what households did in the past."

The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are \u201cdreadfully afraid,\u201d but the driver is \u201cnot in the least disturbed.\u201d In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \u201cdisturbed\u201d can mean disorganized, the text doesn\u2019t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \u201cdisturbed\u201d can mean offended, the text doesn\u2019t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another\u2019s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character\u2019s lack of fear.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how Maggie Lena Walker addressed the lack of financial services available to Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. In this context, \"rectify\" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"prolong\" would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"retain\" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"highlight\" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities."

Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood.\n\nShe crossed the woods she knew so well. The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms. They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.",
    "question_text": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river.",
      "It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods.",
      "It emphasizes Shakti\u2019s sense of belonging in the landscape.",
      "It conveys Shakti\u2019s appreciation for her long-term friendships."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti\u2019s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and \u201cwelcoming,\u201d as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as \u201can old friend\u201d of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti\u2019s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti\u2019s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn\u2019t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti\u2019s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like \u201can old friend\u201d to the woods, so she isn\u2019t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase \u201cas an old friend\u201d figuratively in reference to Shakti\u2019s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \u201cconcede\u201d means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \u201cBronze Age societies were ruled by men.\u201d But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \u201cvaluable objects signaling a high position of power,\u201d which would raise the possibility that \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201cwaive\u201d means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn\u2019t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \u201crefute\u201d means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team\u2019s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201crequire\u201d means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d"

      "State a preference about where to eat.",
      "Change the subject to talk about something else."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it directly applies the research findings described in Text 2 to the situation underlined in Text 1. The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends are deciding on a lunch location. Text 1 goes on to explain that people often don\u2019t reveal their true preferences in such situations, instead claiming they\u2019re fine with any option so that they can appear more easygoing and likable. Text 2 presents research that advises against this approach, stating that people who don\u2019t express their preferences aren\u2019t viewed as more likable and that this behavior actually makes decisions more difficult for others. Since Text 2 specifically argues against the strategy of concealing preferences and indicates negative outcomes from doing so, the author of Text 2 would most likely recommend stating a preference about where to eat.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is addressing how to make joint decisions effectively (through stating your own preference), not advocating for avoiding such decisions entirely. Choice B is incorrect because asking where the friend typically likes to eat still avoids stating one\u2019s own preference. While this approach might seem considerate, it continues the pattern of not revealing true preferences that Text 2 identifies as problematic. Choice D is incorrect because changing the subject would avoid making any decision altogether, which contradicts the implied advice in Text 2. The author of Text 2 presents research suggesting that directly engaging with the decision by stating preferences helps others make decisions and makes you appear more likable."

The text begins by summarizing the main conclusion of the study conducted by Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confronted with ideas they disagree with in discussions about controversial topics, people are more likely to respond politely if they think about their personal values before engaging in such discussions. The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues\u2019 experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic.

After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped find jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women\u2019s transition as their circumstances changed.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams\u2019s work as a political activist and writer for the Chicago Defender, it doesn\u2019t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women. Choice C is incorrect.

Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t discuss the factors that motivated Black men to migrate. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions the difficult employment prospects for Black women in the domestic and agricultural sectors in the South during the Great Migration, the text\u2019s main purpose isn\u2019t to provide an overview of the employment challenges Black women faced in these sectors.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cassumed\u201d most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first \u201cirregular and misty,\u201d or haphazard and indistinct, the figure\u2019s outline gradually showed \u201cdistincter grace and beauty\u201d until the general design of the carved object \u201cwas now obvious to the common eye,\u201d or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cassumed\u201d can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can\u2019t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cassumed\u201d can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can\u2019t speculate about its own precision."

      "invented",
      "adjusted",
      "featured",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ester Hernandez\u2019s art. In this context, \"featured\" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez\u2019s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"invented\" would mean created something for the first time, which isn\u2019t supported since the text doesn\u2019t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they\u2019re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because \"adjusted\" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez\u2019s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez\u2019s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because \"recommended\" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn\u2019t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez\u2019s works. Instead, the text mainly develops a contrast between where Hernandez\u2019s early works could once be viewed and where her work can be viewed now."

    "prompt": "Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets.

The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were influenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen\u2019s findings as \"unexpected.\" Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farmworkers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain why a certain rap album is particularly innovative.

All of these characteristics of the album and the way in which it was developed help to demonstrate the album\u2019s novelty.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because though the text mentions an album that combines elements of scholarly essays and mixtapes, it does not compare the relative public impact of scholarly articles and albums. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not present the opinion of a scholar regarding the rap album.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Hishida Shuns\u014d\u2019s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms. In this context, \"embraced\" means accepted or adopted readily. The text begins by identifying Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of Nihonga, or classical (that is, traditional) Japanese painting. The text continues by drawing a contrast between Hishida\u2019s work and Kuroda Seiki\u2019s work, which differs from that of Hishida in its use of the traditional European method of using oil paints on canvas rather than using traditional Japanese approaches. The text then concludes with an example of one such traditional Japanese painting technique exemplified by Hishida\u2019s Cat and Plum Blossoms\u2014applications of color pigments to a silk scroll\u2014to further develop the contrast between the two artists\u2019 approaches. This context supports the idea that Hishida adopted, or embraced, traditional Japanese approaches.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"distrusted\" would mean that Hishida was skeptical of or lacked confidence in traditional Japanese approaches to painting. The text begins by stating that Hishida\u2019s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is an example of Nihonga, or traditional Japanese painting, and then cites Hishida\u2019s application of color pigments to a silk scroll as an instance of a traditional Japanese painting technique. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Hishida\u2019s use of traditional Japanese painting techniques indicates his distrust, or skepticism, of them. Rather, it suggests that he embraced those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Hishida \"released\" traditional Japanese approaches to painting in this context would mean that he freed them from any restrictions. In using Hishida\u2019s application of color pigments to a silk scroll in Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of a traditional Japanese approach to painting found in Nihonga, the text strongly implies that Hishida followed these approaches, not that he removed them from any restrictions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"overlooked\" would mean ignored or failed to notice. The text establishes that Hishida\u2019s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is a notable work of Nihonga, or classical Japanese painting, that features the traditional technique of applying color pigments to a silk scroll. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Hishida\u2019s use of a traditional Japanese approach to painting indicates that Hishida failed to notice those approaches."

Astrophysicist Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not sufficiently reveal Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be firmly fixed.",

      "It explains how the work of Nance and colleagues was received by others in the field."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren\u2019t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don\u2019t have enough information about the star\u2019s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn\u2019t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn\u2019t.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn\u2019t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn\u2019t address this information at all."

In this context, \"successful\" means accomplishing a goal or purpose. According to the text, conservationists planted more than 500,000 native trees in an Azores bullfinch habitat in order to boost the bird\u2019s population size. The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees. Thus, in this context, the conservationists\u2019 approach of planting native trees was successful because it achieved the goal of increasing the bird\u2019s population size.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists\u2019 approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch\u2019s numbers was \"amusing,\" or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address how much it cost to achieve the goal of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch\u2019s numbers. The text indicates that the approach was beneficial and successful rather than \"costly,\" or expensive or harmful. Choice D is incorrect.

In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables\u2014that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners\u2019 conclusions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"circumvent,\" or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it\u2019s possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners\u2019 conclusions, but findings from a study can\u2019t choose to get around something.

Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"implement,\" or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners\u2019 conclusions, but findings from a study can\u2019t put anything into effect."

In this context, \"optimize\" means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don\u2019t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing tool, some businesses aren\u2019t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"adorn\" would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren\u2019t enhancing the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren\u2019t utilizing an effective marketing opportunity, not that they aren\u2019t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"endorse\" would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text\u2019s discussion of the fact that some businesses have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn\u2019t support the idea that those businesses therefore don\u2019t approve of their own marketing. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, saying that businesses don\u2019t \"counteract\" their marketing would suggest that they don\u2019t actively undermine it or make it ineffective.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the W boson. In this context, \"scale\" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the W boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle\u2019s mass to be much greater (\"seven standard deviations higher\") than had been expected based on a standard model. This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that there was a very large difference between the predicted mass and the actual measured mass of the subatomic particle, it doesn\u2019t explain the cause of, or reason behind, that difference. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the measurements of the subatomic particle were notable because they differed from expectations and also because a difference existed between the measurements and what had been predicted; the text would be repeating the idea that there was a difference instead of adding to that idea. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t convey any implications of, or consequences of or conclusions drawn from, the fact that the mass of the subatomic particle differed from expectations; the context indicates only that the actual measured mass was much higher than the predicted mass."

While working on her translation of a novel written in Odia (a language of India) into English, the narrator looks out her window at night to clear her mind.\n\nI tried to distract myself with these sights of the ordinary world, but in my mind it was the lines I had been translating and the lines that I had been writing that remained in the forefront.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"completing\" most nearly means finishing. In the text, the narrator conveys that the task of translating a novel has been an all-consuming one and that she hopes things will \"be normal again\" once she has \"sent off the manuscript.\" In other words, the narrator is looking forward to finishing her work on the manuscript and returning to other things.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn\u2019t mean destroying, or ruining. The narrator addresses her desire to send off the manuscript she\u2019s focused on and her hope that things will be \"normal again\" once she does, conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the work, not to ruining it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn\u2019t mean advertising, or publicly promoting. The narrator addresses her complete focus on the translation and her hope that things will be \"normal again\" once she has \"sent off the manuscript,\" conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the task, not to promoting the resulting manuscript. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn\u2019t mean rejecting, or refusing or repelling. The narrator makes it clear that she is absorbed in working on the translation and plans to send off the manuscript, suggesting that instead of refusing to do the work, she is continuing to do it (even if she looks forward to things being \"normal again\" when she\u2019s done)."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nPublic policy researcher Anthony Fowler studied the history of elections in Australia, a country that requires citizens to vote. Fowler argues that requiring citizens to vote leads to a significant increase in voters who would otherwise not have the time or motivation to vote. Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reflect the preferences of the country as a whole.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nGovernments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Theia and the origin of the Moon. In this context, \"notional\" means theoretical or only an idea. The text indicates that although something was once true of Theia, the protoplanet one theory holds collided with Earth and created debris that became the Moon, researchers now claim to have identified pieces of it deep in Earth\u2019s mantle. In other words, having direct evidence of Theia is a new development. This context suggests that before evidence was found, Theia was only theoretical\u2014that is, that it was notional.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Theia, a protoplanet, was \"desultory,\" which in this context would mean moving away from the matter at hand; indeed, the text focuses on the \"big whack\" theory of the origin of the Moon and indicates that Theia is a central part of that theory. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes the point that something was true of Theia until recently and suggests that this has changed now that researchers believe they have found pieces of the protoplanet deep in Earth\u2019s mantle. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Theia was actually \"spurious,\" or false, until researchers found direct evidence of the protoplanet. (Although Theia\u2019s existence might not have been certain, it would not have been false simply because there was no evidence of it.) Choice C is incorrect because the text makes the point that something was true of Theia until recently and suggests that this has changed now that researchers believe they have found pieces of the protoplanet deep in Earth\u2019s mantle. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Theia was \"veritable,\" or real, before researchers found direct evidence of its existence: the evidence would instead confirm that Theia was real."

In this context, \u201cinexperienced with\u201d means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \u201cprepared for\u201d\u2014or ready for\u2014speaking Quechua wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \u201cskilled in\u201d\u2014meaning good at or capable of\u2014speaking Quechua wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect. Flores Rivera was likely \u201cexcited about\u201d\u2014or thrilled or delighted with\u2014speaking Quechua, but this wouldn\u2019t make sense in context.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about people\u2019s tendency to dismiss claims from sources perceived as self-interested, or acting for their own advantage. In this context, \"irrelevant\" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim\u2019s truthfulness\u2014a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"indistinct\" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable. Instead of suggesting that the source of a claim can\u2019t be determined with certainty, the text suggests that recognizing a source and having an opinion of it simply doesn\u2019t matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indisputable\" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn\u2019t logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self-interested, it doesn\u2019t go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can\u2019t be questioned\u2014the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn\u2019t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"implicit\" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don\u2019t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates."

As used in this context, \u201crepudiates\u201d means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo\u2019s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a \u201crejection\u201d of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television\u2019s general tendency regarding Native characters.\u00a0\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo\u2019s \u201crejection\u201d of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Harjo \u201cproclaims,\u201d or declares or affirms, television\u2019s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television\u2019s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo \u201cforetells,\u201d or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo\u2019s \u201crejection\u201d of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo \u201crecants\u201d something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Harjo recants television\u2019s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn\u2019t a belief and thus isn\u2019t something that can be recanted."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cspread\u201d most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is \u201chuge,\u201d that it covers \u201cnumberless acres,\u201d and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text\u2019s emphasis on the zoo\u2019s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers \u201cnumberless acres,\u201d then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo\u2019s large size.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cspread\u201d can mean coated, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

In this context, \u201chealthy\u201d would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase \u201con the other hand\u201d indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \u201cstruggling\u201d would mean working against difficulties. The text first describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase \u201con the other hand\u201d then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \u201cbeneficial\u201d would mean producing good or helpful effects.

The text discusses the Bayeux Tapestry, making the point that the workers who produced the huge tapestry in the eleventh century might not have ever produced a tapestry so large before. The text goes on to suggest that because of this lack of previous experience, the workers developed and refined the process of joining the tapestry\u2019s panels over time as they worked. The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers\u2019 process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn\u2019t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France. Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence doesn\u2019t address the location where the Bayeux Tapestry was created; the first sentence of the text presents it as a given that the tapestry was created in France, but nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined."

The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although \u201ccontracted\u201d can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke\u2019s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorrect because settled means calmed or mitigated, but here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d not that it has been somehow calmed or mitigated."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of historical evidence about ancient Egypt under the reign of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. In this context, \"an exhaustive\" account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed\u2014in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign is unlikely.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"an imaginative\" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"a superficial\" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable."

The text begins by discussing ordinary soap bubbles, objects that usually exist for less than a minute before popping due to either evaporation or gravity-induced drainage. The text then goes on to mention work by researchers Aymeric Roux and colleagues, who have discovered how to increase the longevity of bubbles by altering their chemical composition. Finally, the underlined portion of the text describes how this process works: since the bubble contains both water and glycerol, it can draw water molecules from the surrounding air to replace those lost to evaporation. Therefore, the underlined portion of the sentence describes the effects of a process devised by researchers that increases the longevity of an object described in the text.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the circumstance that prompted the research is discussed in the first sentence of the text, not the underlined portion. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text does not address why soap bubbles must eventually rupture. Rather, it explains how the longevity of soap bubbles can be extended.

The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn\u2019t view the genre as impossible to enter.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \u201clegitimate\u201d would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn\u2019t think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \u201ccompelling\u201d would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that she didn\u2019t see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn\u2019t consider science fiction \u201cindecipherable,\u201d or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of noses on ancient sculptures. In this context, \"fragile\" means weak or delicate. This matches the text\u2019s description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures\u2019 heads because they are \"especially easy to break.\" Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures\u2019 heads.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"recognizable\" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn\u2019t be \"common,\" or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn\u2019t relate to the noses being \"sophisticated,\" or knowledgeable or refined."

Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids\u2019 constituents are not reliable: conjugation may alter constituents\u2019 physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but.\n\nText 2\n\nThe potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles\u2019 potential to damage DNA.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn\u2019t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don\u2019t argue that the benefit outweighs the risk. They merely argue that \u201cthe effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.\u201d Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation \u201cvary by case,\u201d and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren\u2019t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids \u201chas drawn deserved attention,\u201d so they aren\u2019t denying the problem."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to convey the speaker\u2019s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility, or peace. The text begins by expressing the speaker\u2019s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the \"slumberous lullaby\" formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried \"gently...between a peaceful sea and sky.\" All these details serve to emphasize the speaker\u2019s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Given the poem\u2019s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn\u2019t refer directly to any such hardship\u2014ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn\u2019t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can\u2019t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker\u2019s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn\u2019t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest the speaker has any qualms, or reservations, about being transported by the ocean. On the contrary, the speaker actively desires to \"drift far out\" and be carried by the waves and wind. Moreover, the poem doesn\u2019t suggest that this drifting would have any particular destination."

At the start of the text, Jane says, \u201cI went on with my day\u2019s business tranquilly,\u201d indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is \u201cinvoluntarily framing advertisements\u201d (meaning that she can\u2019t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new \u201csituations\u201d (or jobs) would be like.\u00a0\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane\u2019s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane\u2019s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying\u2014she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she \u201cshould\u201d quit her current job (indicating that she hasn\u2019t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts \u201cmight germinate and bear fruit if they could,\u201d meaning that the thoughts haven\u2019t yet led to a decision\u2014that Jane isn\u2019t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins\u2019s video art. As used in this context, \u201cnewfound\u201d means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn\u2019t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \u201cdelicate\u201d means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it\u2019s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cinevitable\u201d means impossible to avoid, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because \u201chabitual\u201d means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins\u2019s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time."

The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don\u2019t understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited. Thus, the underlined portion notes a factor\u2014very low cost\u2014that led the researchers to not completely dismiss risk-disclosure messaging despite their evidence of its limited utility.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t refer to a particular type of risk-disclosure messaging, whether Seira et al. considered it or not; the underlined portion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (broadly) is very low, which makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging\u2019s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low\u2014meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there\u2019s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited."

Brierley et al.\u2019s research directly challenges Wright\u2019s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually \u201cpreserved vegetation\u201d rather than depleting it.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.\u2019s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples\u2019 behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara\u2019s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples\u2019 practices did not \u201cexacerbate aridity\u201d (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.\u2019s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region\u2019s vegetation and climate.

The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are \"awkward,\" or lacking skill or grace.

Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlefish seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"manageable\" would mean capable of being controlled.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of residential mobility decisions. In this context, \"mediated by\" means influenced or affected by something. The text establishes that increasing household spending power (an economic factor) produced \"mixed effects\" on mobility decisions. The text then explains that residential choices are \"not fully reducible to economic factors,\" which means that these decisions don\u2019t simply rely on how much money is available to spend on a residential move but on other factors as well. According to the text, noneconomic considerations, such as access to social networks, also play a significant role. Thus, \"mediated by\" accurately captures this relationship where noneconomic factors influence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"transposed with\" would suggest that economic and noneconomic factors are being switched or interchanged when making residential mobility decisions, which wouldn\u2019t make logical sense in this context. The text indicates that these factors coexist and jointly influence such decisions. Choice C is incorrect. The phrase \"decoupled from\" means separated or disconnected from, which would suggest that economic factors are completely separate from noneconomic factors. This would contradict the text\u2019s main point that residential mobility decisions involve multiple factors being considered simultaneously rather than in isolation. Choice D is incorrect because \"antecedent to,\" which means something prior or earlier, would indicate that noneconomic factors come before economic ones in time or sequence.

That\u2019s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn\u2019t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn\u2019t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes\u2019 survival.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nMicrobes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it\u2019s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer\u2019s team\u2019s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.",
    "question_text": "Based on the texts, Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
      "A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
      "Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
      "Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer\u2019s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn\u2019t appear to contain any life. Fierer\u2019s team says that though this doesn\u2019t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it\u2019s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer\u2019s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer\u2019s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer\u2019s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn\u2019t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn\u2019t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer\u2019s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them, but the author doesn\u2019t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer\u2019s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples."

The text portrays a woman who is looking at \u201ctrees in their spring beauty.\u201d She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the \u201ceasy unhuman loveliness\u201d of trees: she thinks of cities as \u201cseductive\u201d and \u201ccharming,\u201d both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are \u201cdemanding,\u201d or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though \u201csignaling,\u201d or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of \u201cbeckoning,\u201d in the context here, \u201cbeckoning\u201d suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word \u201csignaling\u201d alone. Therefore, \u201csignaling\u201d is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are \u201cshifting,\u201d or changing shape."

Trever thinks that the \u201chyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people\u201d interpretation ignores the sculptors\u2019 imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way.

In this context, \"arduous\" means that the process is marked by great labor or effort. According to the text, the creation of the 1926 animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed took three years and was a painstaking process. Since the process was so long and required great efforts by Lotte Reiniger and her team, the creation of the film was therefore an arduous process.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the creation of Reiniger\u2019s film was \"a haphazard,\" or disorganized, process. In fact, the text suggests that the creation process was quite meticulous and the team worked hard together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does suggest that the creation of Reiniger\u2019s film was a long and difficult process, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the process was \"a contentious\" one, or one causing controversy or argument. The text suggests that the team worked together to produce the envisioned effects.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson\u2019s painting career.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson\u2019s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson\u2019s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general. Choice D is incorrect because, rather than call it into question, the underlined sentence continues the discussion of Johnson\u2019s career by adding further relevant detail of Johnson\u2019s artistic transformation."

      "It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others would generally avoid."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months\u2019 work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer\u2019s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel\u2019s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel\u2019s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text\u2014that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right."

At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nIn their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana\u2019s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna.

Choice C is incorrect. The texts don\u2019t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana\u2019s painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others."

    "prompt": "Very little is known about the role nocturnal insects, such as moths, play in flower pollination because it is difficult to monitor insects at night. To address this problem, a team of scientists used time-lapse cameras to record pollinator visits to red clover all day and night. The recordings showed that while most pollinator visits were by bumblebees, one-third of visits were by moths. Additionally, flowers that were visited by both moths and bees produced more seeds than flowers that were only visited by bees.",

The sentence indicates that scientists used time-lapse photography during both day and night to detect pollinators visiting red clover. Therefore, the underlined sentence has the function of describing an approach scientists used in the pollinator study discussed in the text.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence discusses equipment the scientists used to conduct their study, and the text provides nothing to suggest these elements of their experimental design could, by themselves, question claims resulting from the study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined sentence or the rest of the text addresses whether moths have a preference for red clover or any other flowers. Choice D is incorrect. Although the sentences that follow the underlined sentence discuss research findings, nothing in the text suggests that these findings were unexpected. Moreover, the underlined sentence describes part of the scientists\u2019 experimental design (day and night time-lapse photography), not a finding of the scientists\u2019 study."

The text details how sand cats have rigid hyoids that produce purring sounds when their larynx vibrates, while lions have more flexible hyoids attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that enables roaring but may prevent purring.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t present facts that weaken the theory about two cat species; rather, it asks a question about two species and then discusses a potential answer. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the habitats of sand cats and lions at all, nor does it mention any changes to their habitats.

The text explains that the Apollo equipment is still on the Moon, but the data it collected \"were mostly inaccessible\" until a data-transfer project was undertaken. The text then states that this project allowed a researcher to use the information that has been collected. This context makes it clear that the project made previously inaccessible data available, or accessible.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that a project made data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon \"predictable\" would mean that the data could be known or declared in advance, and it\u2019s not clear how that would be achieved, particularly with data that had been \"mostly inaccessible\" before the project. Rather than suggesting that the data-transfer project made the data predictable, the text conveys that it made the data available to be used as sources of information. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence indicates that data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon were \"mostly inaccessible\" until a recent data-transfer project did something to them, after which a researcher was able to make use of the data. This context conveys that the project made the data accessible and usable, not that it made them \"complicated,\" or complex or difficult to understand. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, \u201cinadequate\u201d means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes \u201cthe loss of material quality.\u201d The text contrasts that with Chazovachii\u2019s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text\u2019s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cresilient\u201d would mean able to withstand difficulty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any difficulties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \u201cdynamic\u201d would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii\u2019s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201csatisfactory\u201d would mean acceptable but not perfect.

The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly\u2014that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm\u2014each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201cquantities\u201d means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn\u2019t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \u201cdecorations\u201d would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201cagreements\u201d would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about.

Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth\u2019s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth.

The text begins by explaining that g\u00fciros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that g\u00fciros\u2019 sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201coverlooked\u201d means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by g\u00fciros are overlooked or not noticed.

In this context, \"consistent\" means steady or unchanging over time. The text introduces a challenge and then explains that wave power varies, or changes, unpredictably in ways that cause problems for electricity generation. This context conveys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn\u2019t indicate that wave power isn\u2019t \"accidental,\" or isn\u2019t happening unintentionally. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to describe waves\u2014a natural occurrence\u2014as happening intentionally.

A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O\u2019Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O\u2019Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O\u2019Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same\u2014posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture\u2019s effects on cognition.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture\u2019s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture\u2019s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture\u2019s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O\u2019Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O\u2019Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes."

Muir states that the water beneath the boat \"was so clear that it was almost invisible,\" suggesting that those on the boat were able to see through the water and easily observe plants and fish below the surface.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"simple,\" or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water, and water isn\u2019t typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasizes the water\u2019s transparency, not its simplicity. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"understandable,\" or reasonable or easily comprehended, but Muir is describing the water, and it doesn\u2019t make much sense to describe water as understandable. Muir emphasizes the water\u2019s transparency, not how easily the water can be understood. Choice C is incorrect. Although \"clear\" can mean \"obvious,\" or easily seen or understood, in some contexts, Muir\u2019s description emphasizes that the water \"was almost invisible\" and that the boat seemed to be \"sustained in the air,\" suggesting that the water was almost impossible to see, not that it was obvious."

Mammoth tusks grew in sequential layers, incorporating ingested minerals and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the ratio of strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) in the local environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows where the animal roamed during life.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as a whole. The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arctic woolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (or layers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers\u2019 hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding range in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals of staying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather, the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice C is incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency to stay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed to show whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tusk showed that the mammoth\u2019s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined statement mentions a trait shared by a number of animals (their fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a hypothesis regarding the origin of that trait; rather, the researchers are concerned with whether another particular animal shares that trait."

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, \"stymie,\" which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because in this context, \"compound\" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"disparage\" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create. The text does suggest that workers providing funds to retirees works against those workers\u2019 wealth accumulation, but not that the support to retirees exceeds the workers\u2019 accumulated wealth."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the utility of the Oase 1 fossil to paleoanthropologists. As used in this context, \"discern\" means to detect or recognize something, especially something hidden or obscure. The text indicates that the Oase 1 fossil can help paleoanthropologists recognize patterns in the evolutionary process and shed light on (\"illuminate\") the period in which Oase 1 lived. Thus, the fossil will enable researchers to gain insights into, or discern, facts that are still not well understood.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"exploit\" would suggest that the paleoanthropologists are using \"steps in the evolution of hominids,\" which does not make logical sense. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help paleoanthropologists learn about hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"prioritize\" would suggest that either the paleoanthropologists are placing more importance on \"steps in the evolution of hominids\" than they are on something else not identified in the text or that they are placing these steps in some sort of order. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help paleoanthropologists learn about hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice D is incorrect because to say that paleoanthropologists could \"yield\" or generate \"steps in the evolution of hominids\" doesn\u2019t make sense. The researchers may develop new insights into those evolutionary steps, but they do not create those steps themselves. Rather, the context makes it clear that they are detecting or discovering patterns based on their study of the Oase 1 fossil."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how Nia Imara facilitates the study of star formations. As used in this context \"intangible\" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"repeatable\" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because \"explicable\" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because \"regrettable\" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imara believes the researchers regret the star formations or find them distressing, but rather that she uses interactive models to physically study them."

As used in this context, \u201cpersistent\u201d means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka \u201ccontinuously worked to promote public health,\u201d traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka\u2019s effort was persistent.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka\u2019s effort related to public health as \u201cimpartial,\u201d or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka\u2019s continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specifically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka\u2019s effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to describe it as \u201coffhand,\u201d or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka\u2019s effort to promote public health was \u201cmandatory,\u201d or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator. Rather than suggesting that Wauneka\u2019s effort was required for any reason, the text emphasizes the continuous and extensive nature of her work."

According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy\u2014after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nIn 2015, physicists Tiago Batalh\u00e3o et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can\u2019t solve: at a microscopic level, the \u201claws of physics\u201d suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn\u2019t explain why. This supports Author 1\u2019s point that physicists still don\u2019t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level\u2014maybe the laws need to be revised.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (\u201cthese things can\u2019t be reversed\u2014like time\u201d) was still true on the microscopic level\u2014meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level.

The text explains that Pico \u201chonors the centrality of nature\u201d and also makes it clear that he doesn\u2019t enjoy being in nature.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"\u2014that is, comparatively very little\u2014in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel\u2019s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there\u2019s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn\u2019t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn\u2019t imply that graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written\u2014that is, well crafted\u2014as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted."

    "prompt": "The following text is adapted from James Baldwin\u2019s 1956 novel Giovanni\u2019s Room. The narrator is riding in a taxi down a street lined with food vendors and shoppers in Paris, France.\n\nThe multitude of Paris seems to be dressed in blue every day but Sunday, when, for the most part, they put on an unbelievably festive black. Here they were now, in blue, disputing, every inch, our passage, with their wagons, handtrucks, their bursting baskets carried at an angle steeply self-confident on the back.\n\n\u00a91956 by James Baldwin",

      "Disapproving of",
      "Asserting possession of",
      "Providing resistance to"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \"disputing\" most nearly means providing resistance to. The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi\u2019s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn\u2019t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn\u2019t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi\u2019s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn\u2019t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street."

Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times.\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nIn 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla C\u00e1ceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, C\u00e1ceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding\u2014contrary to their expectations\u2014that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools\u2019 species diversity.",

Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nCattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years. However, this would likely involve only a small change in agricultural water consumption, since water once dedicated to raising cattle would be diverted to raising crops instead.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "By emphasizing that since agricultural water consumption would remain static in the event of replacing beef consumption with mycoprotein consumption, an effort must be made to substitute mycoprotein for chicken and pork in diets as well",

      "By pointing out that some countries are responsible for greater deforestation than others and thus, to have any significant effect on the environment, will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study findings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people\u2019s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people\u2019s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries\u2019 varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein."

The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery\u2019s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn\u2019t suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate.

The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author\u2019s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo\u2019s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn\u2019t the only thing that influences flamingos\u2019 coloring.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos\u2019 feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn\u2019t notice a change wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos\u2019 shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn\u2019t discuss the diet of flamingos at all."

The text provides an overview of Florence Price\u2019s importance by describing her success at the 1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards, her blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, and the recent performances and recordings of her concertos and symphonies by major orchestras.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text does mention that Price\u2019s compositions have been performed and recorded by major orchestras, but it doesn\u2019t argue that more orchestras should do so. Choice C is incorrect. The text does mention the blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, but only briefly, as part of a broader overview of Price\u2019s career. Choice D is incorrect. The text mentions Price\u2019s blending of Black spirituals with classical European Romantic musical traditions, but it doesn\u2019t directly compare Price\u2019s scores with those of classical European composers."

    "prompt": "Some bird species don\u2019t raise their own chicks. Instead, adult females lay their eggs in other nests, next to another bird species\u2019 own eggs. Female cuckoos have been seen quickly laying eggs in the nests of other bird species when those birds are out looking for food. After the eggs hatch, the noncuckoo parents will typically raise the cuckoo chicks as if they were their own offspring, even if the cuckoos look very different from the other chicks.",
    "question_text": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "It introduces a physical feature of female cuckoos that is described later in the text.",
      "It describes the appearance of the cuckoo nests mentioned earlier in the text.",
      "It offers a detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior discussed in the text.",
      "It explains how other birds react to the female cuckoo behavior discussed in the text."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don\u2019t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence\u2019s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn\u2019t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds\u2019 nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it\u2019s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds\u2019 reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they\u2019ve hatched."

    "prompt": "Changes to vegetation cover and other human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, though how deep these effects extend is unclear. Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to differences in carbon and nitrogen levels that are not restricted to the topsoil layer (0\u201330 cm deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, cropland, forest) within each of several Ethiopian locations.

      "It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientific debate, discusses how a research team tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team collected that validate the hypothesis."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis regarding this question\u2014which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer\u2014and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team\u2019s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team\u2019s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn\u2019t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team\u2019s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn\u2019t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn\u2019t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo\u2019s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo\u2019s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis."

In this context, \u201ccommonalities with\u201d means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuac\u00e1n (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuac\u00e1n influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuac\u00e1n. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows \u201crefinements of,\u201d or improvements on, Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuac\u00e1n influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it\u2019s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn\u2019t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture, the Tikal citadel\u2019s builders improved on it.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing \u201cprecursors of\u201d Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture\u2014or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture\u2014would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuac\u00e1n. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac\u00e1n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac\u00e1n, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture, then the Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there\u2019s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people\u2019s \u201canimosities toward,\u201d or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture."

      "Affectionate",
      "Suspicious"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"sheltering\" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker\u2019s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting\u2019s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"\u2014a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker\u2019s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can\u2019t return the speaker\u2019s love. The text continues by stating that there\u2019s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof\u2019s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive\u2014that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn\u2019t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion."

The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, \u201chis ears could not help receiving the words\u201d). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance\u2019s ears couldn\u2019t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don\u2019t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word \u201ccarry\u201d can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one \u201ccarries the blame\u201d for a mistake)."

In this context, to \u201csimulate\u201d most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth\u2019s early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth\u2019s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth\u2019s climate in the distant past.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence\u00a0as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth\u2019s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to \u201cinvent,\u201d or imagine, a completely fictional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth\u2019s past climate might have been like. They are not attempting to \u201cexaggerate,\u201d or distort, those features. Choice D is incorrect because the computer models do not \u201cpreserve,\u201d or protect from deterioration, Earth\u2019s early climate; instead, they attempt to reproduce the characteristics of that climate, based on the remaining physical evidence of that climate."

Led by experienced organizers such as Dorothy Cotton and Septima Clark, CEP attendees\u2014more than 7,000 in all\u2014participated in workshops on topics ranging from public speaking to legal doctrine before returning home and using their newly acquired knowledge to spearhead local civil rights initiatives.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists\u2014more than 7,000\u2014who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP\u2019s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion mentions some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined portion or the text as a whole addresses the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\u2019s philosophy or the attendees\u2019 opinions thereof.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"supported\" most nearly means held up or sustained physically. The sentence describes the physical structure of the Panhandle bridge, stating it was \"supported by massive sandstone pillars.\" This clearly refers to the structural relationship between the bridge and its pillars\u2014the pillars physically hold up the bridge and keep it standing. The text further emphasizes the physical nature of this support by describing the pillars as \"stalwart\" (strong and sturdy) and noting they\u2019ve been performing this function for fifty years.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"supported\" can mean \"encouraged,\" the sandstone pillars and bridge described in the text are all inanimate objects that can\u2019t provide or receive encouragement. The text clearly describes a structural relationship between the elements of the bridge, not an emotional one. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"supported\" has a meaning similar to \"improved on,\" the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the sandstone pillars have enhanced or made the bridge better; rather, they simply provide the necessary physical foundation to keep the bridge standing. Thus, the sentence describes the structural elements of the bridge, not improvements made to it. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"supported\" can mean \"defended,\" the text doesn\u2019t present a situation in which the sandstone pillars are defending the bridge from a threat.

      "By claiming that the specific activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif\u2019s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. \u00a0However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively\u2014that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California\u2019s coast.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad\u2019s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California\u2019s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad\u2019s \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position."

The text explains that Marija\u2019s job was to make sure that her sister\u2019s wedding proceeded in certain ways (\"in due form\") and that she loudly directed everyone\u2019s actions all day. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others \"conformed to the proprieties\"\u2014that is, that they behaved in appropriate ways\u2014that she failed to \"consider them herself\"; that is, she didn\u2019t take standards of appropriate behavior into account and follow them in her own actions.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to think about something in a positive way\u2014which can involve admiration\u2014but the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) on others that she didn\u2019t admire and praise them herself. The context suggests it\u2019s more likely that Marija did speak positively of \"due form\" and \"the best home traditions\" while ensuring others behaved in certain ways. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to come to a decision, but the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Marija wasn\u2019t able to make a decision for herself about the \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) she ensured everyone else conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija knew very clearly which behaviors others should follow as \"due form\" and \"the best home traditions.\" Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to have an opinion, but the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Marija wasn\u2019t able to have an opinion on the \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) she was ensuring others conformed to.

The first sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase \"closely mirrors\" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars.

Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been \"corrupted,\" but only that traditional dating methods are difficult in Sterkfontein because of floods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there\u2019s a \"potential for misdating\" when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones.

The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits\u2019 survival.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph\u2019s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren\u2019t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd\u2019s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn\u2019t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to describe the family of plants known as the silversword alliance and explain why the plants came to exhibit \"an extraordinary range of phenotypes.\" The text introduces the silversword alliance as a family of plants unique to the Hawaiian Islands, presenting those that mature into vines and those that mature into shrubs and trees as examples of different phenotypes. The text concludes by explaining that these plants are all descendants of \"a single ancestral tarweed plant\" that arrived 5 million years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, where a \"wide variety of habitats\" drove the plant\u2019s descendants to adapt and thus differentiate themselves, diversifying into a group of related but distinct species with different physical characteristics.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text explains why the plants within the silversword alliance have varied physical characteristics, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that tarweed is the ancestor of all plants on the Hawaiian Islands. The text states instead that all members of the silversword alliance descend from a single tarweed ancestor.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. \u201cIndicator\u201d means \u201csomething that shows or suggests,\u201d which matches Taleb\u2019s argument that an item\u2019s age can suggest how much longer it will last.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item\u2019s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb\u2019s theory, an item\u2019s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A \u201cmotivation\u201d is \u201ca reason for doing.\u201d Items don\u2019t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. \u201cCriticism\u201d can mean \u201cdescribing faults or problems\u201d or \u201can analysis of an artistic work.\u201d Neither of these definitions makes sense here. An item\u2019s age can\u2019t criticize how much longer it will last."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nFilms and television shows commonly include a long list of credits naming the people involved in a production. Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone\u2019s contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, film and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nVideo game scholars face a major challenge in the industry\u2019s failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium\u2019s development can be difficult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its best-known innovators can be difficult to trace.",
    "question_text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the discussion in Text 2?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "By recommending that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 consider employing the methods regularly used by film and television researchers",
      "By pointing out that credits have a different intended purpose in film and television than in the medium addressed by the scholars mentioned in Text 2",
      "By suggesting that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 rely more heavily on credits as a source of information than film and television researchers do",
      "By observing that a widespread practice in film and television largely prevents the kind of problem faced by the scholars mentioned in Text 2"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium\u2019s development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text\u2019s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games\u2014the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how\u2014is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers\u2014namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members\u2014the author doesn\u2019t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television\u2014namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text\u2014video games\u2014rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, \"nullify\" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In this context, \"denigrate\" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"underestimate\" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"misconstrue\" would most nearly mean misunderstand. Since transport costs are not capable of understanding, it would not make sense to claim that intranational transportation costs misconstrue the price advantages of importing goods."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza\u2019s artistic process. In this context, \"inspired by\" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza\u2019s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is \"complimented by\"\u2014or praised by\u2014something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as \"uncertain about\"\u2014or unsure or doubtful of\u2014direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn\u2019t recall them, and Garza wouldn\u2019t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as \"unbothered by\"\u2014or uninterested in\u2014her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza\u2019s artistic process. The text indicates that Garza\u2019s art comes from memories of her childhood in Texas and details of her surroundings in California."

      "It conveys the speaker\u2019s sense of feeling a pull toward home while traveling in an unfamiliar place.",
      "It reveals that upon returning after an extended absence, the speaker longs for the way a location once felt."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole. In the opening line of the text, the speaker describes wandering in \"alien lands,\" which establishes that the speaker is traveling in unfamiliar territory. In the underlined lines, the speaker describes \"billows\" (large waves) rolling in the soul, which suggests that the speaker feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on to associate these rolling billows with voices calling to the speaker from the speaker\u2019s \"native strands,\" or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home are prompting the emotional experience these lines describe. Taken together, the imagery in the underlined lines thus implies that the speaker feels a deep emotional connection to, or pull toward, home while traveling in an unfamiliar place.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. While the text\u2019s first line states that the speaker is traveling and the underlined lines indicate that the speaker experiences an emotional pull toward home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an enthusiasm about the current travels that conflicts with a growing urge to return home. The text\u2019s description of the lands the speaker is traveling in focuses on their artificial quality, stating, \"Nature her prerogative resigns / To Man,\" which doesn\u2019t suggest enthusiasm but rather a sense of detachment or even critique. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined lines don\u2019t address uncertainty about maintaining links with relatives in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speaker expresses a sense of connection to the speaker\u2019s homeland (\"native strands\") but doesn\u2019t refer to any family members the speaker may have there or to concerns about maintaining any familial ties. Choice D is incorrect because the poem doesn\u2019t indicate that the speaker has returned home after an absence. Rather, the speaker explicitly states, \"I wander among the hills of alien lands,\" establishing that the current setting is a foreign place. Moreover, the underlined lines express a sense of connection with, or pull toward, a distant homeland, not a sense of longing for how that homeland or any other location once felt."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nThe live music festival business is growing in event size and genre variety. With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing \u201cexperiential economy,\u201d where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup.\n\nText 2\n\nMusic festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians\u2019 careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing \u201clived experiences,\u201d and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and profitable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identifies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing \u201clived experiences.\u201d Text 2 doesn\u2019t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention streaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that streaming platforms benefit from the popularity of festivals."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.

The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet officials are responsible for \u201cdevising policies and administering services in accordance with\u201d those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \u201cpresume\u201d in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because in this context \u201cimprovise\u201d would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials \u201cmimic,\u201d or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet officials, is responsible for generating laws.

This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it\u2019s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to \u201cconceptualize,\u201d or form an idea of, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this difficulty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about.

Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely \u201cdiverge,\u201d or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma\u2019s work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul cats live in \"out-of-the-way parts of Asia\" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being \"distant from,\" or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are \"full of large populations of humans\" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text\u2019s claim that the cats live in \"out-of-the-way\" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats\u2019 habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that areas could be \"drawn to,\" or attracted by, large groups of humans. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"responsible for\" would mean either having an obligation to care for something or being the cause of something, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the habitats of manul cats (the areas where the cats live) would need to care for humans or that the habitats somehow created large human populations."

    "prompt": "Vadamalai Elangovan and Ganapathi Marimuthu showed that high moonlight intensity inhibits the activity of the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx), a result explicable in terms of benefits and costs: greater lunar intensity may not enable the bats to increase foraging success enough to offset the higher chance of detection by predatory owls or hawks. Most other nocturnal mammals respond to lunar intensity variations similarly to greater short-nosed fruit bats, but mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) display the opposite pattern, as their heavy reliance on visual foraging results in a different balance of reward and risk.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by describing a study\u2019s finding about greater short-nosed fruit bats\u2014namely, that high moonlight intensity inhibits the bats\u2019 activity\u2014and also accounts for that finding, stating that this occurs because the potential increase in foraging success that greater lunar intensity enables doesn\u2019t offset these bats\u2019 increased vulnerability to predators (whose vision is also implied to become more acute under intense moonlight). The text goes on to characterize this finding as representative of a general pattern, stating that many nocturnal mammals behave similarly in response to changes in lunar intensity. The text concludes by describing an exception to this pattern, explaining that mongoose lemurs display an opposite tendency because they rely heavily on visual foraging. This strategy presumably would allow them to derive more benefit from greater lunar intensity than many other nocturnal mammals would, resulting in a \"different balance of reward and risk\" than exists for other nocturnal mammals. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description and account of a finding, a characterization of that finding as representative of a pattern, and then a description and account of an exception to that pattern.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses two different responses to variations in moonlight intensity, explaining that as moonlight intensity increases, greater short-nosed fruit bats and many other nocturnal mammals decrease their foraging activity but mongoose lemurs increase their foraging activity, it doesn\u2019t leave one of these responses unexplained. The text accounts for both the typical response to increased lunar intensity (reduced activity due to predation risk) and the exception (increased activity due to a reliance on visual foraging) by making reference to a cost-benefit framework. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text presents a study\u2032s finding about the effect of increased lunar intensity on greater short-nosed fruit bats\u2019 activity before going on to contrast this behavior with the fact that mongoose lemurs display the opposite response to increased lunar intensity, the text doesn\u2019t explicitly invoke other studies and doesn\u2019t attribute this difference in observed behavior to the fact that the study of greater short-nosed fruit bats used different methods than studies of mongoose lemurs did. Rather, the text explains that the different observed behaviors can be attributed to differences in species\u2019 foraging strategies. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text characterizes the behavior of mongoose lemurs in response to increased lunar intensity as an exception to a pattern of behavior observed in other nocturnal mammal species, this exception doesn\u2019t cast any doubt on the explanation that is offered for the general pattern observed among other species. Instead, the text uses the same cost-benefit framework to explain why increased lunar intensity is associated with decreased activity by greater short-nosed fruit bats and other nocturnal mammals but with increased activity by mongoose lemurs."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of ways to detect people through walls. In this context, \"inexpensive\" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to \"detect objects or people through walls\": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word \"comparatively\" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as \"costly,\" while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as \"cheap\"; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modification to the smartphones that many consumers already own would presumably result in consumers using that technology to detect objects or people through walls more regularly, or frequently; therefore, it would not be true that such technology would be comparatively infrequent, or uncommon. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that either radar and sonar or changes to smartphone Wi-Fi technology are capable of being misunderstood or mistaken for something else; therefore, it would not make sense to describe changes to Wi-Fi smartphone technology as comparatively unmistakable, or indisputable. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modification to the smartphones that many consumers already own and carry with them would be more functional or practical than radar and sonar, not more impractical, or unrealistic."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text\u2019s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn\u2019t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians\u2019 approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas."

The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn\u2019t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe\u2019s reaction to a new environment.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved.

The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did\u2014that is, they were the most responsive.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become \"inactive,\" or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most \"liked,\" or regarded with pleasure, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others.

      "To call into question the notion that private Roman libraries disappeared during the first century BCE"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes two types of libraries in first-century BCE Rome\u2014private libraries controlled by wealthy individuals, and the public libraries like that commissioned by Emperor Augustus\u2014and then notes that \"these two traditions aren\u2019t as distinct as they seem.\" It explains that both private-library owners and the emperor saw their libraries as \"extensions of their personal patronage, just on vastly differing scales,\" because the emperor\u2019s patronage extended to the whole citizenry of Rome. Thus, both private and public libraries in ancient Rome were fundamentally tied to relevant principles of patronage.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text mentions that Rome\u2019s republican period only to say that it \"ended in the first century BCE,\" thus it doesn\u2019t support any conclusions about possible occurrences \"throughout Rome\u2019s republican period.\" Choice B is incorrect. The text neither discusses \"early imperial leaders in Rome,\" nor whether their level of influence was appropriate. Rather it discusses the end of \"Rome\u2019s republican period\" in relation to libraries, who created them, and who got to use them without passing judgment on propriety. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Rome\u2019s republican period \"ended in the first century BCE,\" a period that also saw the first public library come into use (28 BCE), nothing in the text suggests that private libraries disappeared at that time."

    "prompt": "The following text is from Paul Laurence Dunbar\u2019s 1913 poem \u201cThe Poet and His Song.\u201d\n\nA song is but a little thing,\n\nAnd yet what joy it is to sing!\n\nIn hours of toil it gives me zest,\n\nAnd when at eve I long for rest;\n\nWhen cows come home along the bars,\n\nAnd in the fold I hear the bell,\n\nAs Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,\n\nI sing my song, and all is well.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "To convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel",
      "To compare the speaker to a singing shepherd",

      "To describe the pieces of music the speaker enjoys hearing"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because is accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by declaring that although a song is \"but a little thing,\" or seemingly insignificant, singing it brings joy and gives the speaker of the text \"zest,\" or excitement, in \"hours of toil.\" The remainder of the text explores the idea that as night is falling, singing allows the speaker to feel that \"all is well.\" Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in \"hours of toil,\" and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one. Moreover, the text describes the feelings that the speaker has when singing a song, not the song itself."

As used in this context, \u201cdisparate\u201d means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon\u2019s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon\u2019s work are disparate.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon\u2019s artwork, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the influences are \u201ccomplementary,\u201d or that they complete one another or make up for one another\u2019s deficiencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to characterize Cannon\u2019s influences as \u201cunknown,\u201d or not familiar; it\u2019s clear that the influences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon\u2019s work, not that they are\u00a0 \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d or capable of being used in one another\u2019s place."

In the text, the author discusses her home life.\n\n[I]n California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in. Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night.\n\n\u00a92005 by Joan Didion",

      "It illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.",
      "It summarizes the information that came before it in the text.",
      "It explains that the house remains cold even in summer.",
      "It suggests that the author feels comfortable in her home with or without a fire."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses were heated by building fires year-round. The underlined portion then indicates that the fires didn\u2019t merely provide physical warmth: they also represented being \"home\" and feeling protected. The underlined portion thus illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t summarize information that came before it. Whereas the previous two sentences describe fires\u2019 ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the psychological comfort the fires offered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text\u2019s second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn\u2019t the focus of the underlined portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense of being home and safe. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion focuses on the emotional significance the author places on having a fire going inside the home. There is no indication that the author feels equally comfortable without a fire present."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"conceivable\" most nearly means capable of being thought of or imagined. The text describes a journey that, despite being \"insignificant in distance,\" was \"by no means an easy one\" because of the variety of obstacles that \"nature had determined to throw\u2026in the way.\" To emphasize the difficulty of the journey, the author portrays nature as actively scheming to present travelers with every obstacle that can be thought of\u2014i.e., every imaginable obstacle.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"conceivable\" does not mean obvious, or evident. Instead, by referring to \"every conceivable obstacle,\" the text suggests a wide variety of challenges by evoking all the potential difficulties nature could present, not just those that the travelers might reasonably expect or foresee. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"conceivable\" does not mean straightforward, or easy to negotiate. The text is not indicating that the obstacles were simple to respond to and overcome. Rather, the text suggests that a wide range of obstacles made the journey difficult. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"conceivable\" does not mean uninterrupted. Although the text suggests that the obstacles were frequent and numerous, it does not emphasize the obstacles\u2019 continuity; instead, the text conveys their unexpected variety and range."

    "prompt": "San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the cultural life of the city.",
    "question_text": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco",

      "To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city\u2019s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn\u2019t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals\u2014or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as \u201ca living showcase of San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit,\u201d the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",

The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to \u201cgo forth\u201d with her encouragement (\u201cmy heart\u2019s desire\u201d). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (\u201cGreat reaches, yet unknown\u201d) lie ahead for the son that \u201clife is calling\u201d him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (\u201cGreat reaches\u201d) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (\u201cyet unknown\u201d) or suggesting that they should match the speaker\u2019s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (\u201cGreat reaches, yet unknown\u201d) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (\u201clife is calling you!\u201d), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her son in a positive light when she says that \u201cgreat reaches, yet unknown\u201d are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the son is consistent throughout the text."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of businesses being featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County. In this context, \"advantageous\" means beneficial or providing a favorable position. The text explains that being included in the book \"suggested that a business was an important part of the community,\" and it can be inferred that an enhanced reputation within the local community would benefit a business, commercially or otherwise. This context supports the idea that being featured in this publication would be advantageous.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"risky\" would suggest that being featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County might have negative consequences for a business. However, the text implies only positive outcomes since inclusion indicated importance within the local community. Choice B is incorrect because \"misleading\" would mean deceptive or deliberately giving a wrong impression, but the text doesn\u2019t indicate there was something deceptive about being featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County; rather, it suggests that inclusion indicated community importance. Choice D is incorrect because \"unremarkable\" would mean common or ordinary, which doesn\u2019t make sense in context.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"soft\" most nearly means gentle. The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding \"nice\" and similar to someone \"kissing the window.\" These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"gentle\" can mean sensitive, or caring about others\u2019 feelings, that isn\u2019t the meaning in this context; it doesn\u2019t make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a definite shape; she isn\u2019t indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how \"nice\" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how \"nice\" it is."

The underlined portions describe the young artists and intellectuals at the gathering as trying to \"hew out,\" or give shape to, their views of art more clearly, but with each seeming to be using \"an ill-balanced axe\" and then feeling that the \"strokes had gone awry.\" In context, the metaphorical language comparing attempts to refine concepts of art to imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe serves to emphasize how much the individuals at the gathering struggled to articulate, or express, their thoughts; indeed, the text explains that the individuals couldn\u2019t quite grasp why their statements had gone awry and tended to try to rectify, or correct, them in continued discussion after they sat down.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portions characterize aspects of the young artists and intellectuals\u2019 attempts to present their general views of art more clearly, not their views of the reputation of a certain artwork; the text never mentions any specific artwork or its reputation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the underlined portions refer to a physical activity\u2014cutting wood with an axe\u2014the descriptions are metaphorical rather than literal. The text isn\u2019t describing people constructing works of art, large-scale or otherwise; rather, it\u2019s describing people talking at a gathering, using the idea of imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe to suggest that each individual struggled when trying to present their view of art more clearly. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portions do provide a reason for the young artists and intellectuals\u2019 discontent, the text focuses on the fact that they were each dissatisfied with their own statements, not on how they felt about the group\u2019s full conversation about art. Instead, the text explains that each individual tried to present their view of art more clearly but struggled (as if imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe), couldn\u2019t grasp what went awry, and then felt the need to rectify, or correct, what they had just said. It\u2019s possible that the individuals were also discontented with the group\u2019s conversation overall, but neither the underlined portions nor the text as a whole suggest that."

In this context, \u201cpaucity of\u201d means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj\u2019s research, the text uses the word \u201cthough\u201d to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text\u2019s use of the word \u201cmany\u201d provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the first type.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context for there to be a \u201cquarrel about,\u201d or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level.

There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context for there to be a \u201cprofusion of,\u201d or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text\u2019s use of the words \u201cthough\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, \u201cprofusion of\u201d would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types.

    "prompt": "Musician Joni Mitchell, who is also a painter, uses images she creates for her album covers to emphasize ideas expressed in her music. For the cover of her album Turbulent Indigo (1994), Mitchell painted a striking self-portrait that closely resembles Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear (1889). The image calls attention to the album\u2019s title song, in which Mitchell sings about the legacy of the postimpressionist painter. In that song, Mitchell also hints that she feels a strong artistic connection to Van Gogh\u2014an idea that is reinforced by her imagery on the cover.",

It then goes on to provide an example of how Mitchell\u2019s self-portrait on the cover of Turbulent Indigo\u00a0resembles a painting by Van Gogh, which the text indicates helps emphasize the strong connection Mitchell feels toward Van Gogh, a connection that is also expressed in the album\u2019s title song.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because there are no references in the text to artists other than Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that calls attention to any similarities or differences between Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Instead, it mentions that Mitchell feels a strong \u201cartistic connection\u201d to Van Gogh.

The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus \u201coverreacts,\u201d or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cretaliates\u201d means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves benefits for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient."

To \"popularize\" a technology is to allow it to be used and appreciated widely. The text explains that unlike the photos produced by earlier forms of photographic technology, carte de visite photos were inexpensive and could easily be obtained by \"everyday people,\" who enjoyed exchanging the images. Therefore, carte de visite photos helped popularize photography.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that instead of weakening the emerging technology of photography, carte de visite photos allowed it to be more widely accessed and enjoyed by people. Choice B is incorrect. The text establishes that large numbers of people enjoyed using carte de visite photos, so it can be inferred that these photos caused photography to be praised, or celebrated. However, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that inanimate objects\u2014in this case, photos\u2014had praised photography; instead, carte de visite consumers themselves would have praised it.

The first sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, the text describes the first part of that journey, which begins with the geese flying over the Gulf of Alaska while keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese\u2019s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it. Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese\u2019s typical winter migration journey.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual flight behavior, the underlined portion doesn\u2019t discuss this. Instead, the underlined portion describes the first part of the Tule geese\u2019s typical winter migration journey over the Gulf of Alaska. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence containing the underlined portion mentions that Tule geese breed in Alaska, the underlined portion doesn\u2019t explain why the geese breed in that location. Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it\u2019s the starting point of the Tule geese\u2019s typical winter migration.

The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who \u201ccite the album as an influence.\u201d Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by Keyboard Fantasies, it doesn\u2019t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album\u2019s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Keyboard Fantasies was not admired on its first release, the text doesn\u2019t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t mention any differences between Keyboard Fantasies and the work of Blood Orange and Moses Sumney."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, \"indulge\" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to \"despise,\" or hate, others\u2019 vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature\u2014that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he tried to \"moderate\" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he attempted to \"criticize,\" or speak disapprovingly of, those vices."

Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a student would contradict those earlier views. Choice C is incorrect. \"Entrenching\" means \"solidifying.\" A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not solidify views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest\u2019s admiration of William Faulkner\u2019s writing style. In this context, \"imitation\" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner\u2019s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner\u2019s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest\u2019s novel Divine Days and Faulkner\u2019s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest\u2019s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner\u2019s style.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, a \"forgetting\" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s style and the fact that Forrest\u2019s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner\u2019s stylistically. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner\u2019s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a \"rejection\" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest\u2019s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn\u2019t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner\u2019s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an \"opinion\" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest\u2019s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner\u2019s style, the word opinion wouldn\u2019t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn\u2019t say that the passage from Forrest\u2019s novel expresses his view of Faulkner\u2019s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner\u2019s writing."

The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of \u201cfrequent climbers,\u201d such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity\u2014the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were \u201csurpassed by,\u201d or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn\u2019t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.

The text indicates that critics found the play to have \u201cthe opposite effect\u201d on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers.

The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for.

In this context, \u201csaturated with\u201d means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi\u2019s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are \u201csusceptible to,\u201d or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are \u201ccontingent on,\u201d or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are \u201cdepleted of,\u201d or empty of, bicycles while others have an insufficient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand\u2014the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up.

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases. These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nIn a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began\u2014extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull\u2019s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull\u2019s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull\u2019s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull\u2019s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull\u2019s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim."

The officials passed a law requiring demolition companies to deconstruct some buildings instead. Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landfill.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. \u201cSuitable\u201d means \u201cappropriate for a particular purpose.\u201d Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith\u2019s choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. \u201cArbitrary\u201d means \u201cbased on random choice or whim rather than reason.\u201d But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith\u2019s choice was \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, \u201cintricate\u201d would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a \u201cweb of relations\u201d in which the crops interact in various ways. The text\u2019s description of these interactions\u2014the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use\u2014provides context suggesting that this \u201cweb of relations\u201d is intricate.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \u201cindecipherable,\u201d or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text\u2019s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not \u201cornamental,\u201d or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \u201cobscure,\u201d or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text\u2019s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not obscure."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nWhen the 50-second-long film Arrival of the Train\u2014which depicts what its title says, a train pulling into a station\u2014was first shown publicly in 1896, spectators, na\u00efve to the new medium of film and seeing a train appearing to come directly at them, leaped from their seats and fled the room. This moment marks a major cultural shift: a new way of representing and seeing the world had arrived with that train, and nothing would ever be the same.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nThe fact that there is no contemporary evidence that the first audience of Arrival of the Train was alarmed has not stopped the story from becoming canonical, even among film historians. But that phenomenon itself is highly revealing. Our belief that the coming of film was transformative is so strong that we invented and keep retelling a founding myth that divides cultural history into a (na\u00efve) \u201cbefore\u201d and (sophisticated) \u201cafter.\u201d",

      "It is not based on evidence and reflects film historians\u2019 belief that they are more sophisticated than today\u2019s audiences.",
      "It reflects a misconception that is widely believed because it captures early film audiences\u2019 sense that the new medium was alarming."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it provides a statement about the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 that, based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with. Text 1 indicates that members of the audience, unaccustomed to the new medium of film and believing that they were looking at a real oncoming train, allegedly reacted to the film with alarm. Text 1 then goes on to treat this anecdote as a factual account of the film\u2019s first showing, interpreting it as a moment that marked a \"major cultural shift.\" In contrast, the author of Text 2 indicates that though the story of the film\u2019s first showing has become \"canonical,\" or widely accepted, there is no contemporary evidence to support the idea that the audience reacted as Text 1 describes. Text 2 goes on to explain that this factually questionable description likely persists because it functions as a \"founding myth\" that reinforces a widespread belief in the profoundly transformative nature of the invention of film. This indicates that the author of Text 2 would likely see the description in Text 1 as motivated primarily by cultural perceptions about film\u2019s significance rather than by documented historical facts.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn\u2019t suggest that film historians regard the view about film\u2019s transformative nature as na\u00efve. On the contrary, Text 2 states that the story of the first showing of Arrival of the Train has become \"canonical, even among film historians,\" indicating that historians broadly accept this narrative as a compelling illustration of film\u2019s impact, not that they regard either the narrative or the views it conveys about the transformative nature of film as na\u00efve. Text 2 refers to a \"(na\u00efve) \u2018before\u2019\" in cultural history, but this is describing how the myth itself characterizes pre-film audiences, not how historians regard views about the transformative nature of film. Choice C is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 does indicate that the story of the audience\u2019s reaction to Arrival of the Train described in Text 1 is a myth that lacks evidence, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the story reflects the fact that film historians believe themselves to be more sophisticated than modern audiences are. Rather, Text 2 suggests that the story persists because of a collective cultural belief, which historians share, in the profound impact of the invention of film. Moreover, the \"na\u00efve\" versus \"sophisticated\" distinction mentioned in Text 2 refers to how the myth characterizes audiences before and after the invention of film; it doesn\u2019t characterize modern audiences versus film historians. Choice D is incorrect. Although the author of Text 2 would agree that the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 reflects a misconception, the author wouldn\u2019t agree that widespread belief in the misconception can be attributed to the fact that it accurately captures early audiences\u2019 actual sense of alarm. In fact, the misconception identified by the author of Text 2 concerns the accuracy of the audience\u2019s alleged reaction; the author questions whether early audiences were alarmed at all, stating there is \"no contemporary evidence\" that they reacted in this way. According to Text 2, the description is widely believed not because it accurately captures historical reactions but because it serves as a \"founding myth\" that supports a belief in film\u2019s transformative cultural impact."

The narrator reveals that she \u201chad to act really happy\u201d about the piano even though she \u201cpretty much hated the thing\u201d as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free.

Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator\u2019s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator\u2019s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novels. In this context, \u201cpartnership\u201d means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf\u2019s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf\u2019s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf\u2019s novels.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a \u201crebellion,\u201d or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf\u2019s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a \u201cdiscovery,\u201d or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters \u201cworked closely\u201d together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf\u2019s novels; the text doesn\u2019t mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a \u201cdisagreement,\u201d or conflict."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian. In this context, \"homogenous\" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum\u2019s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text\u2019s discussion of Native art is framed around this art\u2019s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cendure\u201d most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cendure\u201d can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can\u2019t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others\u2019 absences, not on her treatment of others."

Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses the relative appeal of certain colors in paintings but gives no indication that any colors would ever be \"corrected by\" viewers, or somehow fixed or improved by them. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to say that some colors are more \"similar to\" viewers than others, which would suggest that colors and viewers are alike to different degrees.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by pointing out one of the advantages of oral histories: that they allow researchers to document the daily experiences of people. The text then goes on to describe how Karida Brown utilized interviews with coal miners and their families for her book about twentieth-century coal mining in Kentucky. The underlined sentence affirms that the general advantages of oral histories mentioned earlier in the text were also benefits in Brown\u2019s particular case. Thus, the underlined sentence describes how Karida Brown benefited from incorporating oral history in her book.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because though the text mentions coal miners who live in Kentucky, the underlined sentence does not offer a geographical fact about Kentucky. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence does not mention United States politics or that Brown is an expert in this particular area. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Brown\u2019s book revolved around coal miners during the twentieth century, the underlined sentence does not focus on a major historical event during this time."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nFor decades, bluegrass musicians have debated whether their genre should exclude influences from mainstream genres such as rock. Many insist that bluegrass is defined by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such \u201cpurists,\u201d as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nBluegrass isn\u2019t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues. Since bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it influences from rock and other mainstream genres.",

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nStage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the first to argue that light must be considered alongside all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unified performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia\u2019s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia\u2019s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren\u2019t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nAdolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.",

The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner\u2019s claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was \u201cnot an amateur in the practice of lighting.\u201d His experience as a lighting specialist\u2019s apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 argues, allowed Appia to \u201c[develop] his understanding of what was possible\u201d with the elements of theatrical design.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia\u2019s ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn\u2019t relevant to Bremner\u2019s evaluation of Appia\u2019s technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia\u2019s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about Appia\u2019s familiarity with or ignorance of the use of music and sound in theater.

As used in this context, \u201csynchronization\u201d means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because referring to \u201chibernation,\u201d or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in\u2014making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \u201cprediction,\u201d or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \u201cmoderation,\u201d or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant\u2019s flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison."

Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat.

The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds and that other bursts generated by neutron mergers have usually lasted fewer than 2 seconds. In other words, the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A was unusual.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a difference between the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A and the typical duration of bursts caused by neutron mergers, not \"a coincidence,\" or a point of correspondence, between them; the text indicates that GRB 230307A lasted much longer than what is typical of other bursts. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"a reprieve\" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself. Choice C is incorrect. Although it would make sense to refer to gamma ray burst GRB 230307A itself as \"an incident,\" or a thing that occurred, the missing word describes the duration of the burst, and it doesn\u2019t make much sense to describe a length of time as an incident.

Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she\u2019s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although \u201cno one seemed to know\u201d strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that \u201cno one seemed to know the origin\u201d of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ \u201cwidely\u201d and likens them to \u201ctwo separate worlds,\u201d these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator\u2019s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them."

In this context, \"superseded\" means surpassed or exceeded by something else. The text establishes that this plant has \"the largest known\" genome among eukaryotes and mentions \"the high biological costs of extremely large genomes,\" suggesting there are natural constraints that make it biologically disadvantageous to maintain such massive genetic material. This context supports the idea that it\u2019s unlikely another organism will evolve an even larger genome that would replace this plant\u2019s record\u2014that is, its status as having the largest genome is unlikely to be superseded.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"protracted\" would mean drawn out over time or space, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry \"high biological costs.\" This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it\u2019s unlikely to be protracted. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"curtailed\" would mean cut short or reduced, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry \"high biological costs.\" This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it\u2019s unlikely to be curtailed. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"obviated\" would mean made unnecessary or redundant, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry \"high biological costs.\" This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern\u2019s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it\u2019s unlikely to be obviated."

The text first states that animals make use of objects as tools to help them achieve different goals. The text then explains that although people used to think only primates use tools, tool use by dolphins (aquatic mammals) and palm cockatoos (birds) has shown that primates are not the only animals that use tools. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to argue that a variety of animals, not just primates, use tools.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention intelligence at all, focusing just on the idea that animals use tools. Further, the text mentions one kind of bird (palm cockatoos) only as an example of a non-primate that uses tools and describes its use of tools as creative, not unintelligent. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions tool use in primates (a group that includes humans) and in palm cockatoos, it doesn\u2019t compare humans\u2019 tool use with palm cockatoos\u2019 tool use. The text mentions palm cockatoos only as one example out of the variety of animals that use tools and never directly mentions tool use in humans. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses tool use but never makes any mention of intelligence.

In other words, the prediction was a theory\u2014a well-supported explanation\u2014that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn\u2019t \"evidence,\" or proof, of that event\u2019s existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a \"constant\" is a situation or factor that doesn\u2019t change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time\u2014it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an \"experiment,\" or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test."

Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn.

The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren\u2019t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren\u2019t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can\u2019t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn\u2019t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups."

Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. Siraj\u2019s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in \u201cgeological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact\u201d as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj\u2019s hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of long-period comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva\u2019s argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj\u2019s hypothesis. Siraj\u2019s hypothesis doesn\u2019t make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj\u2019s hypothesis. \u201cSoil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater\u201d is too vague.

In this context, \"defunct\" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim\u2019s Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021.

Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it\u2019s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because \"ubiquitous\" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them.

Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is \"extraneous,\" or irrelevant.

This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nRecently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements. The group developed a new measure called the \u201cdegree of urbanization.\u201d This new measure establishes global criteria used to define three types of settlements (cities, towns, and rural areas) and allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.",
    "question_text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the problem presented in Text 1?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "By recommending that a specific institution should further investigate the problem",
      "By suggesting that researchers focus on topics besides urbanization",

      "By noting that a possible solution to the problem is available"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because Text 2 presents a possible solution to the problem identified in Text 1\u2014that is, how disparities in the criteria used by different countries to define urban settlements make it \"difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.\" Text 2 describes the creation of a shared framework for studying global urbanization: \"global definitions of common types of settlements\" and a \"new measure called the \u2018degree of urbanization\u2019\" that \"allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 mentions \"a group of six international organizations\" that developed criteria and a measure related to settlements and urbanization, no organization or institution is singled out to perform further research. Choice B is incorrect because both texts are about urbanization research and neither mentions any other fields of study. Choice C is incorrect. Text 2 discusses a possible solution to the terminological problem in global urbanization research, not additional areas of difficulty in the field."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Kelmscott Press\u2019s books. In this context, \"manifest in\" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization was \"scrutinized by,\" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions\u2019 use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris\u2019s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris\u2019s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press\u2019s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books. Instead, the text presents those methods as exemplifying Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization."

      "feasible",
      "substantial",
      "unnecessary"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the difficulty in naming a large number of minor planets. In this context, \"insurmountable\" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible\u2014or insurmountable\u2014which explains why the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \"feasible\" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorrect because \"substantial\" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn\u2019t logically explain why the naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because \"unnecessary,\" which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose. However, the text doesn\u2019t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical because of the volume."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nFrench Impressionist artist Edgar Degas insisted that his paintings be kept in their original frames after they were sold. Like many Impressionist painters, Degas used painted frames that stood in contrast to the gold frames frequently seen at the Paris Salon, a prestigious art exhibition that was sponsored by the French government and promoted traditional painting styles. Impressionist painters likely chose these colorful frames to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nImpressionist painters often focused on the interplay of color and light in their works. As such, those Impressionists who placed their works in painted frames instead of the more traditional gold ones did so for aesthetic reasons: a frame\u2019s color was likely chosen because it would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting. Gold, conversely, could distract from the subtleties in a painted scene.",
    "question_text": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "Gold frames were considered especially desirable by those who purchased works from Impressionist painters.",
      "The colors in an Impressionist painting were often chosen to complement the colors of the frame it would be placed in.",
      "Many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.",
      "Degas\u2019s preferred framing style was different from that of most Impressionist painters."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the statement about the use of painted frames in Impressionist painting that both authors would be most likely to agree with. Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas\u2019s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire \"to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters \"placed their works in painted frames\" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that \"the frame\u2019s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting.\" Though differing on Impressionist painters\u2019 rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn\u2019t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to \"harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,\" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas\u2019s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters\u2019 attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn\u2019t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1\u2019s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it."

This suggests that the paintings are displayed in a systematic, or organized, way.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. \"Ranked\" might mean either classified or placed in orderly rows. Neither of these meanings would necessarily imply that the names of the paintings are easy to see (even if the paintings are placed in rows, their labels might be obscured). Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to describe the paintings as \"scheduled,\" or planned to take place at a certain time. Choice D is incorrect because if the paintings were \"discussed,\" or talked about, this would have no bearing on whether the names of the paintings could be easily seen."

As used in this context, \u201cprescribed\u201d would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are \u201csocially dictated\u201d (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were \u201cinterjected,\u201d or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. There\u2019s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \u201csocially dictated,\u201d not expectations that society has \u201ccommitted,\u201d or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \u201csocially dictated,\u201d not expectations that have been \u201cillustrated,\u201d or clarified with examples.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Hegel\u2019s works. In this context, \"opaque\" means difficult to understand or unclear. The text creates a contrast between the initial impression given by Hegel\u2019s works and their influence and insight, noting that readers must \"penetrate Hegel\u2019s frustratingly dense prose\" to access his important ideas. This context clearly establishes that Hegel\u2019s writing is initially challenging to comprehend, or opaque.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"authoritative\" means influential or clearly accurate. Hegel\u2019s works may be authoritative, but it wouldn\u2019t make logical sense in context to say that although his works seem authoritative, they have been influential. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Hegel\u2019s works are challenging to read, but that working through the dense prose can be rewarding. Choice C is incorrect because referring to Hegel\u2019s works as \"empirical,\" which means factual or verifiable, would suggest that they are based on observation or experience rather than theory. The text, however, doesn\u2019t address this aspect of Hegel\u2019s philosophy. Instead, it focuses on the difficulty of understanding his writing.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the role of the general store in US rural communities during the 1800s. In this context, \"source\" means a place where something originates or is obtained. The text states that people would share news while socializing at the general store. This context supports the idea that the store served as a source of information in rural communities.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \"rival\" would mean competitor or opponent. The text doesn\u2019t indicate that the general store was a rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the general store as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rural communities. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"condition\" would mean state, circumstance, or requirement. Although the text implies that visiting the store was helpful for acquiring information since people shared news there, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the general store was a condition of information. Choice D is incorrect because \"waste\" would mean something that is unused, discarded, or spent unnecessarily, which would not make sense in context. The text describes the general store as an essential part of daily life and a place for socializing and information sharing. The store was therefore a source, not a waste, of information."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nLike the work of Ralph Ellison before her, Toni Morrison\u2019s novels feature scenes in which characters deliver sermons of such length and verbal dexterity that for a time, the text exchanges the formal parameters of fiction for those of oral literature. Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison\u2019s novels, both in structure and prose style, these scenes suggest Ellison\u2019s direct influence on Morrison.\n\nText 2\n\nIn their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison\u2019s works recall those in Ellison\u2019s. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed. Morrison\u2019s use of the sermon is attributable not only to the influence of Ellison but also to a community-wide strategy of resistance to externally imposed literary conventions.",
    "question_text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "As failing to consider Ellison\u2019s and Morrison\u2019s equivalent uses of the sermon within the wider cultural context in which they wrote",

      "As disregarding points of structural and stylistic divergence between the works of Ellison and those of Morrison",
      "As being indebted to the tradition of resisting literary conventions that privilege written forms, such as novels, over sermons and other oral forms"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 2 argues that Morrison\u2019s use of the sermon is not only influenced by Ellison, but also by a \u201ccommunity-wide strategy of resistance\u201d to literary conventions practiced by Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many influences on Morrison.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Neither text specifically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding \u201cthe division between oral and written forms\u201d among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence. Text 2 simply suggests that Morrison was influenced by more than just Ellison. Choice D is incorrect. While Text 2 does discuss Morrison\u2019s resistance to certain literary conventions, it\u2019s unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim to be \u201cindebted\u201d to that tradition.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of traffic signals. As used in this context, \u201cfeatured\u201d means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US traffic signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn\u2019t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was first developed. Before then, the text suggests, traffic signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word \u201conly\u201d in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traffic signals featured only red and green lights.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201cavoided\u201d means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traffic signals look like. The text states that they didn\u2019t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cappreciated\u201d means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn\u2019t mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes \u201ctraffic signals,\u201d which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because \u201cdisregarded\u201d means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss how people react to traffic signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes \u201ctraffic signals,\u201d which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner."

      "To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and fish together",
      "To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius\u2019s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood\u2019s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text\u2019s many examples of Julius\u2019s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t portray either the narrator\u2019s or his wife\u2019s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn\u2019t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it\u2019s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish\u2014a detail that supports the text\u2019s main purpose by conveying Julius\u2019s usefulness."

A Barbie is a type of doll.\n\nI begged Mago to come play with me. She wasn\u2019t as interested in my Barbie as she had been just two months before, which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for. Usually, it was me doing the envying. After I pestered her relentlessly, she finally put her notebook down and came over to me.\n\n\u00a92012 by Reyna Grande",

      "It provides a reason for why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text. The underlined portion (\"which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for\") directly expresses Grande\u2019s unhappiness about her sister\u2019s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that Grande feels sad and explains why Mago\u2019s disinterest particularly affects her\u2014because it was the one rare instance where her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion states that Grande feels sad about Mago\u2019s disinterest in Grande\u2019s Barbie, not angry about Mago\u2019s refusal to spend time with her. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has previously taken an interest in Grande\u2019s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in the past, the underlined portion doesn\u2019t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago\u2019s recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago\u2019s motivation or reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande\u2019s emotional reaction to Mago\u2019s disinterest in Grande\u2019s Barbie and explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande."

Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters\u2019 interior states in great detail, whereas Orlando propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters\u2019 psychology more superficially.

      "By concurring that the reputation of Orlando as a minor work has led readers to overlook this novel but maintaining that the reputation is unearned"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando in Text 1. Both authors agree that Orlando is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters\u2019 psychologies more superficially than Woolf\u2019s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls Orlando an \u201coddity\u201d and mentions that Woolf \u201cbegan it as a joke,\u201d Text 2 asserts that Orlando engages the same themes as Woolf\u2019s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that Orlando differs from Woolf\u2019s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf\u2019s work as a writer.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is effective. However, there\u2019s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf\u2019s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares Orlando favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that Orlando is less impressive than Woolf\u2019s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics. Choice D is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in Text 1 or Text 2 to suggest that readers have generally ignored Orlando because of its reputation."

The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn\u2019t marked by the lack of \u201can inconclusive\u201d explanation\u2014an explanation that does not resolve the issue\u2014but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they\u2019ve likely been inconclusive ones.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of \u201can unbiased,\u201d or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems.

Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn\u2019t imply that there is little \"vigilance,\" or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classifications and question one another\u2019s decisions.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the purpose of the National Heritage Fellowship. In this context, \"recognize\" means acknowledge or honor someone officially for their achievements. The text states that the fellowship was created for \"exceptional folk and traditional artists.\" It then provides an example of one recipient of the fellowship, circus aerialist Dolly Jacobs, who was given the fellowship \"to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts.\" The fact that the fellowship is given to celebrate exceptional artists for their achievements therefore suggests that its purpose is to publicly honor, or recognize, them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"startle\" would mean alarm or surprise, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that Jacobs and other artists who received the National Heritage Fellowship didn\u2019t expect to receive it or were alarmed by it. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say the fellowship was created to publicly alarm or surprise exceptional artists. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"familiarize\" would mean make known or familiar, but the text gives no indication that Jacobs or other recipients of the National Heritage Fellowship were unknown or unfamiliar before receiving the fellowship or that the fellowship was intended to make them familiar to the public. In fact, the text describes recipients as \"exceptional\" and notes that Jacobs received the award \"to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts,\" both of which suggest that Jacobs and other recipients were already well known in the arts world. Choice D is incorrect because \"convey\" would mean either transport or communicate something, neither of which would be logical in this context. The fellowship doesn\u2019t transport artists, and though the process of awarding the fellowship might communicate something about the artists to the general public, it would be illogical to state that the fellowship communicates the artists themselves.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of research on income inequality in the 2010s. In this context, \"mitigate\" means to make less severe or reduce the negative effects of something. The text first identifies a shortcoming in the research: a \"myopic focus on a few countries\" despite claims of \"global relevance.\" The text then explains that researchers later gained access to new data from previously excluded regions (Africa and Eastern Europe). This context supports the idea that with these new data, researchers would be able to reduce, or mitigate, the identified shortcoming by incorporating a broader range of geographic regions into their studies of income inequality.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"presuppose\" would mean to assume in advance that something is true, and it wouldn\u2019t make logical sense to say that researchers later assumed as true in advance a shortcoming they had already encountered. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"categorize\" would mean to classify or place into groups. The text indicates that researchers did something about the shortcoming that characterized research on income inequality in the 2010s\u2014limited geographic scope\u2014after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Categorizing a shortcoming doesn\u2019t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely categorizing the shortcoming and instead took action to address it. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"validate\" would mean to confirm or substantiate something. The text indicates that researchers did something about a known shortcoming of research on income inequality in the 2010s\u2014limited geographic scope\u2014after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Confirming an already known shortcoming doesn\u2019t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely validating the shortcoming and instead took action to make the shortcoming less severe."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nMost animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans\u2019 comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they\u2019re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nWhen Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear.",

      "It is unfairly dismissive given the progress that Srivastava and her team have reported."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as \u201cespecially promising\u201d and a sign of \u201cexciting progress\u201d in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR\u2019s function in humans isn\u2019t yet known, it\u2019s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1\u2019s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s observations about EGR in humans.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven\u2019t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t say that Text 1\u2019s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1\u2019s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1\u2019s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn\u2019t at all dismissive of Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There\u2019s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1\u2019s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of fiscal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their findings from data that didn\u2019t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn\u2019t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conflict between the research findings and recent events.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the findings of several studies.

Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data.

The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso\u2019s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues\u2019 research into how workload affects productivity. In context, \u201cefficient\u201d means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues\u2019 research, people who worked on hard tasks first were \u201cmore skilled and productive\u201d than those who did easy tasks first. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks first were less efficient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks first.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less \u201csecretive,\u201d or uncommunicative or silent, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because \u201coutgoing\u201d means openly friendly, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text focuses on Kouchaki and colleagues\u2019 research in which people who worked on hard tasks first were \u201cmore skilled and productive\u201d than those who did easy tasks first and were therefore less efficient. Choice D is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less \u201cunsympathetic,\u201d or insensitive or unkind, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones."

The text explains that the same genes that enable certain nonhuman mammal species to hibernate during the winter by altering their bodily processes are also found in our species but have \u201cessentially no effect\u201d on humans\u2019 bodily processes. In other words, these genes don\u2019t function in humans.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \u201cdecisive\u201d means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans\u2014that is, the genes don\u2019t affect humans\u2019 bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \u201clacking\u201d means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cvariable\u201d means characterized by the potential to change, but the text indicates that these genes don\u2019t change in their effect on humans\u2019 bodily processes; instead, the genes are consistently inactive in humans."

In this context, the phrase \u201cdepended on\u201d means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve \u201cbooks, art, and other materials\u201d created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201cadmired\u201d means respected and approved of. Although it\u2019s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn\u2019t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because \u201cdisagreed with\u201d means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg\u2019s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cwarned\u201d means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. Nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg thought his friends and colleagues were in any danger, let alone that he warned them of danger."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nWhen companies in the same industry propose merging with one another, they often claim that the merger will benefit consumers by increasing efficiency and therefore lowering prices. Economist Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of the United States newspaper market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription prices would rise following a merger.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nEconomists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the efficiency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benefits for consumers.",

      "They would recommend that Fan compare the near-term effect of a merger on subscription prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a merger in another newspaper market.",

      "They would claim that mergers have a different effect on consumer prices in the newspaper industry than in most other industries."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan\u2019s findings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn\u2019t benefit customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta\u2019s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn\u2019t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience \"efficiency gains\" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there\u2019s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general."

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn\u2019t know much about the ocean floor in the 1950s. The second sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time\u2014that the ocean floor was mostly flat. The remainder of the text establishes that the ocean floor is far from flat, citing research conducted by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen. Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is to identify a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although Tharp and Heezen\u2019s work with sonar data in the Atlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text, the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identifies a belief held by scientists that Tharp and Heezen demonstrated to be wrong. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence presents a belief held by many scientists in the 1950s; nowhere does the text mention a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen, whom the text describes as research partners working together to map the ocean floor. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t present data in support of a claim; instead, it presents a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen\u2019s work showed to be wrong."

The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France\u2019s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team\u2019s findings.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team\u2019s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nLiterary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka\u2019s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka\u2019s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka\u2019s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\u00a0\n\nIt is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka\u2019s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka\u2019s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka\u2019s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.",

The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka\u2019s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka\u2019s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka\u2019s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out \u201csignificant differences in styles and content\u201d among Soyinka\u2019s plays. Choice C is incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, \u201crecognizable\u201d means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is \u201ceasy to observe in humans,\u201d but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of \u201cless\u201d before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \u201cintriguing,\u201d or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn\u2019t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. \u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \u201csignificant,\u201d or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn\u2019t suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because \u201cuseful,\u201d or functional or helpful, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which researchers can determine whether an animal or person is right- or left-handed, not on how useful handedness in nonhuman animals is compared with handedness in humans."

The text describes how the narrator watches people working out at a gym through a window near a bus stop. The narrator says that \"there ain\u2019t nothing funnier\" than watching people try to work out on the stair climber machine. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe an activity that the narrator finds amusing.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text isn\u2019t about the narrator beginning middle school. The text describes how the narrator finds people working out at a gym amusing and makes no mention of school life. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any problems that the narrator currently has or has overcome. It just describes how the narrator finds watching people work out amusing. Choice D is incorrect because the narrator invents the made-up movie mentioned in the text. The text doesn\u2019t indicate that the narrator has seen a movie in a theater. The focus of the text is on the narrator watching people at the gym, not watching a movie."

This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence\u2019s work as an artist.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \u201cskeptical,\u201d or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reflected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \u201ccritical,\u201d which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reflects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Lawrence was \u201cconfident,\u201d or self-assured. Rather than addressing how Lawrence felt about himself and how that feeling affected his artistic process, the text emphasizes the careful attention Lawrence paid to everything around him\u2014attention that allowed him to capture subtle elements of a particular place and time in his artwork."

In this context, \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d means done without any control, or by reflex. The text explains that when a person\u2019s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneficial for infants), those muscle contractions are \u201cuncontrollable.\u201d This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person\u2019s control.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t support the logical relationship established in the text\u2019s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specific causes for hiccups haven\u2019t been identified, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur \u201cbeneficially,\u201d or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants\u2019 breathing regulation.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are \u201cuncontrollable.\u201d Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur \u201csmoothly,\u201d or evenly and continuously."

The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is \u201caeolian transport.\u201d The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn\u2019t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the text.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn\u2019t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them.

As used in this context, \"sensitive\" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"immune\" means protected or shielded, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because \"limited\" means confined or restrained, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn\u2019t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants. Choice D is incorrect because \"receptive\" means open or tolerant, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t indicate that the wild-rice plants are open to or tolerant of an increase in water depth but rather the opposite: an increase in water depth can harm young wild-rice plants."

Choice C is incorrect. It\u2019s confusing to say that starlight is \"only now running to Earth,\" both because light doesn\u2019t literally \"run\" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it\u2019s traveling to Earth.

In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Ta\u00ednos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect.

The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement\u2019s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement\u2019s participants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

This context supports the idea that the scholars\u2019 skepticism is justified.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201canticipate\u201d means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues\u2019 research couldn\u2019t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar\u2019s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because \u201cinspect\u201d means examine or review, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars\u2019 skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers\u2019 findings justify, not inspect, the scholars\u2019 skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because \u201creveal\u201d means uncover or report, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers\u2019 findings confirm or justify the scholars\u2019 skepticism, which was already known so didn\u2019t need to be revealed."

The text doesn\u2019t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn\u2019t like it.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how rising prices affected demand for vintage cassette tapes. In this context, \"engendering\" means producing or causing to exist. The text indicates that the effect of a dramatic increase in the price of vintage cassettes was counterintuitive, or contrary to what would typically be expected. Generally, when prices rise, demand falls\u2014but the text indicates that in this case, buyers who previously had no interest in cassettes \"thronged the market\" (that is, many of them began purchasing cassettes) because they saw the cassettes as potential investments. This context conveys that the rising prices surprisingly produced significant demand, producing many new buyers for vintage cassettes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to describe the price increase itself\u2014rather than sellers of vintage cassettes\u2014as \"exploiting,\" or unfairly or selfishly taking advantage of, demand. Further, wanting to take advantage of new demand would be a motivation for a price increase, not a counterintuitive effect of it. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"monetizing\" would mean utilizing as a source of profit, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to describe a price increase itself, rather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a source of profit; moreover, seeking to profit when there\u2019s new demand would be a reason for price increases, not a counterintuitive effect of them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"appraising\" would mean assessing the value or significance of something. The text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be reasonable to suggest that sellers might have appraised demand for those cassettes, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that a price increase itself could do such an assessment; moreover, an appraisal of demand would most likely precede a price increase rather than be an effect of it."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how historians have treated rank-and-file (ordinary) workers in their analyses. In this context, \"marginalize\" means treat as unimportant or relatively powerless within a group or society. The text explains that according to Austin McCoy, historians have tended to treat \"political, business, and labor leaders\" as the \"major actors\" involved in making changes in organized labor in the period after the Second World War. By emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, historians have in effect minimized the contributions of ordinary workers, treating them as relatively unimportant and \"nearly devoid of agency,\" thereby marginalizing them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"epitomize\" would mean either serve as an ideal example of something or make into an example of something, neither of which would make sense. In stating that historians have tended to characterize political, business, and labor leaders as the primary actors responsible for changes in the post-Second World War labor movement in a manner that minimizes the influence of ordinary workers, the text suggests that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as unimportant to or uninfluential within the movement, not that historians themselves serve as examples of ordinary workers, or that historians in their analyses have made ordinary workers into examples of the changes that occurred. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"extol\" would mean praise highly or glorify. The text states that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as being \"nearly devoid of agency,\" thereby minimizing their importance. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that in doing so, historians have tended to praise or glorify them. Choice D is incorrect because \"substantiate\" would mean verify with evidence, and nothing in the text suggests that historians have verified rank-and-file workers or their contributions in their analyses. If anything, the text suggests the opposite, implying that by minimizing workers\u2019 agency in organized labor, historians have likely overlooked evidence demonstrating their influence."

In this context, \u201chomogeneous\u201d means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they\u2019re foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don\u2019t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter \u201cpatches of low species richness\u201d\u2014that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species\u2014they\u2019ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don\u2019t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homogeneous.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are \u201cdepleted,\u201d or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are \u201cimmature,\u201d or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models\u2019 predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees\u2019 behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the flower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the flowers are in patches that are \u201cdispersed,\u201d or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there\u2019s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict."

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nIn 2007, a team led by Alice Storey analyzed a chicken bone found in El Arenal, Chile, dating it to 1321\u20131407 CE\u2014over a century before Europeans invaded the region, bringing their own chickens. Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific. Thus, Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably first introduced chickens to South America.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nAn Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by confirming that the mutation identified by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin.",

    "answer_choices": [
      "By broadly agreeing with the claim but objecting that the timeline it presupposes conflicts with the findings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey\u2019s team",
      "By faulting the claim for implying that domestic animals couldn\u2019t have been transferred from South America to the Polynesian Islands as well",
      "By critiquing the claim for being based on an assumption that before the European invasion of South America, the chickens of Europe were genetically uniform",
      "By noting that while the claim is persuasive, the findings of Luzuriaga-Neira\u2019s team provide stronger evidence for it than the findings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey do"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say \u201c[m]ore recently\u201d Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but \u201cthat European breeds lack,\u201d which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira\u2019s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey\u2019s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues\u2019 evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey\u2019s evidence is.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from \u201c1321\u20131407 CE\u2014over a century before Europeans invaded the region\u201d and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey\u2019s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey\u2019s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately reflects the main purpose of the text. The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and flowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks \"stately and calm,\" the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was \"wide open to the long-expected guest,\" which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne\u2019s anticipation and Martha\u2019s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest\u2019s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was \"long-expected,\" but characterizing Miss Pyne as \"stately and calm\" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing)."

In this context, \u201cimportant\u201d means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico\u2019s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the \u201cmany significant accomplishments\u201d from Juarez\u2019s long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico\u2019s history.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez\u2019s role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was \u201cunpredictable,\u201d or tended to behave in ways that couldn\u2019t be predicted.

Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1\u2014that the fossil was avian\u2014is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds.

In this context, \"demarcated from\" means separate or set apart from. The text indicates that diadromous fish differ from euryhaline fish in that diadromous fish \"migrate between freshwater and marine biomes during their life,\" whereas euryhaline fish do not relocate to a different biome because they can tolerate higher salinity environments.

Although the text states that diadromous fish migrate and relocate, the text does not suggest that diadromous fish would be \"reconstituted as,\" or formed again as, anything new. Only their environments change and not the fish themselves. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not suggest that diadromous fish can be \"conflated with,\" or combined with, euryhaline fish. Instead, the text distinguishes the two types of fish by pointing out their differences with regard to migration and tolerance for salinity. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that based on migration habits and tolerance for salinity, diadromous fish are different from euryhaline fish; so it would not make logical sense to say that diadromous fish would be \"derived from,\" or be an extension of or result from, euryhaline fish."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn\u2019t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn\u2019t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn\u2019t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to what the researchers mentioned in Text 1 contend. Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth\u2019s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago. Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.\u2019s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth\u2019s mantle and therefore wouldn\u2019t argue that the temperature of Earth\u2019s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved. The author of Text 2 would only accept empirical evidence."

The analysts themselves couldn\u2019t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue.

Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn\u2019t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \u201cworried,\u201d or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue."

The text indicates that Zepeda\u2019s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute.

In other words, Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group\u2019s movements (\"their passing\") through the area.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn\u2019t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group\u2019s movements through a place (\"their passing\") to anyone who might be following them.

Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren\u2019t very \u201clocalized,\u201d or confined to a particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo\u2019s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There\u2019s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren\u2019t localized and the mammals being varied. Although the text mentions mammal fossils found in China, nothing in the discussion of Luo\u2019s research addresses the limits of Mesozoic mammal habitats."

    "prompt": "Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed in African American communities. Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music\u2019s quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it. Because of jazz music\u2019s influence, jazz tap quickly developed into a dance form that was very different from earlier kinds of tap dance.",

Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to discuss jazz tap\u2019s development.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that jazz music became widely popular in the US in the 1920s and describes some of jazz music\u2019s qualities, the text never explains why audiences prefer some kinds of music\u2014jazz or otherwise\u2014over others. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions any musical instruments and doesn\u2019t describe how to play one. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses jazz tap generally and never identifies a particular dancer, famous or otherwise."

In this context, \u201ccollaboration\u201d means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature.\n\nChoice A is incorrect\u00a0because in this context, \u201ccharacterization\u201d would mean a literary work\u2019s portrayal of characters\u2019 psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn\u2019t discuss characterization in The Mule Bone specifically or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect\u00a0because in this context, \u201cinterpretation\u201d would mean the explanation of a literary work\u2019s meaning or significance, but the text doesn\u2019t discuss how readers or critics have interpreted The Mule Bone; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201ccommercialization\u201d would mean writing a literary work in such a way as to ensure its commercial appeal, but the text never discusses commercial appeal as a factor in the writing of The Mule Bone specifically or the writing of collaborative works more generally."

The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics \u201chave challenged\u201d the economist\u2019s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist\u2019s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist\u2019s projection entirely\u2014the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \u201cdispute,\u201d or argue against, the economist\u2019s projection wouldn\u2019t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn\u2019t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \u201cwithdraw,\u201d or remove from consideration, the economist\u2019s projection wouldn\u2019t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn\u2019t withdraw her projection since they\u2019re an inanimate circumstance and thus can\u2019t choose to remove something from consideration.

As used in this context, \u201cproponent of\u201d means supporter of. The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the phrase \u201csupplement to,\u201d or addition to, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text discusses Sumner\u2019s efforts to increase the number of Black psychology students, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to describe him as an addition to his efforts. Choice C is incorrect because Sumner was already an accomplished psychologist himself when he helped to found the Howard University psychology department.

The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite\u2019s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite\u2019s eye.\n\nChoice A is incorrect\u00a0because \u201cresolved\u201d means determined or figured out, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Peter Edwards as a portrait painter. In this context, having a \"reputation for\" something means that one is widely recognized for being associated with a particular activity. The text indicates that Edwards has created \"characteristic works\" including \"esteemed portraits\" of notable figures, suggesting he is known and respected for this type of painting. This choice clearly indicates that Edwards has established recognition or fame specifically in connection with painting portraits of well-known individuals.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text presents Edwards\u2019s portrait painting in a positive manner, describing his works as \"esteemed.\" In this context, \"complaint about\" would mean dissatisfaction or grievance regarding the activity of painting portraits, which contradicts the positive characterization of Edwards\u2019s work. Nothing in the text suggests that Edwards has expressed any dissatisfaction with or objection to painting portraits of notable figures. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Edwards has a \"question about\" painting portraits, which in this context would mean uncertainty or doubt regarding this activity. Instead, the text presents Edwards as someone who has already created multiple portrait works described as \"characteristic\" and \"esteemed,\" suggesting established practice rather than uncertainty. The mention of specific examples of his portrait work further demonstrates that he is not questioning his portrait painting. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Edwards has a \"requirement for\" painting portraits, which in this context would mean a mandatory obligation or necessary condition. Instead, the text indicates that portrait painting is something Edwards is known for doing well, not something he is obligated to do. The text describes his portrait work as \"characteristic,\" suggesting it\u2019s a defining feature of his artistic practice rather than an externally imposed requirement."

This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don\u2019t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life.

It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it.

This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne\u2019s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation.

Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn\u2019t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla\u2019s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne\u2019s personality."

In this context, \"fluctuations in\" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"\u2014that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"developments of solar energy collection\" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there\u2019s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"calibrations with\" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there\u2019s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice D is incorrect. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); nothing in the text suggests that \"incentives for,\" or rewards for, solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated, especially in countries that want to rely more on solar energy than they already do."

The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante\u2019s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels \u201ctransported with joy\u201d after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character\u2019s happiness after reading the letter.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there\u2019s no explanation why another character hasn\u2019t written one. In addition, the text\u2019s description of Rinaldo \u201cin a melancholy posture\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sad and thoughtful, not that he\u2019s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won\u2019t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn\u2019t want it to fall, the text doesn\u2019t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

The text introduces the concern that pteropods are thought to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, or lower pH levels, due to the susceptibility of their calcium carbonate shells to dissolution at lower pH levels. However, the text then describes findings from a recent study that suggest this concern may be unjustified, insofar as the protective periostracum coating on a pteropod\u2019s shell prevents dissolution, and even when the coating is breached, a pteropod can rebuild the inner shell wall, reducing the damage.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t call for additional research or suggest that more research is needed on biological mechanisms that improve pteropod survival rates. Instead, the text discusses a recent study showing that pteropods may not be as vulnerable to ocean acidification as is feared. Choice B is incorrect because the study discussed in the text doesn\u2019t address calcium carbonate\u2019s role in protecting the periostracum of pteropods. According to the text, the study addresses the periostracum\u2019s role in protecting pteropods\u2019 calcium carbonate shells from dissolution due to ocean acidification.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and finally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more significant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow\u2019s view that humans have flexibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn\u2019t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn\u2019t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (\u201ccommunities that included esteemed individuals\u201d) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because there\u2019s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of programs that encourage money to cycle within a community. In this context, \"instituting\" means initiating. The text indicates that making purchases at small local businesses can help keep money cycling within a community. The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are \"occupying,\" or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss who controls these programs but instead indicates that some cities are establishing incentives that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses. Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that a city is occupying a program. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that cities are \"underestimating,\" or failing to understand the value of, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses. The text indicates that some cities are establishing incentives to encourage small business shopping, which suggests that these cities understand the value of such programs. Choice D is incorrect because saying that some cities are \"encountering,\" or coming into contact with, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that some cities are already establishing incentives to encourage shoppers to make purchases at small businesses. This context suggests that the cities are instituting the programs, not that they are encountering them."

In this context, \"exactitude\" means precision. The text indicates that the Mexica used the sun\u2019s position relative to various natural landmarks to track the passage of time, explaining that such methods allowed the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of important events such as solstices. This context supports the idea that the Mexica people were able to track time with a high degree of precision, or exactitude.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"precariousness\" would mean instability, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the method used by the Mexica people to track time was unstable or produced unstable results. Rather, the text indicates that the method yielded precise results, allowing the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of significant events. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"resilience\" would mean persistence, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the Mexica worked stubbornly in spite of obstacles in order to track time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"inconspicuousness\" would mean discreetness, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the Mexica wanted to track time without being noticed."

The play is based on a short story Yamauchi had published three years earlier. Adapting the story wasn\u2019t easy.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. According to the text, it was hard for Yamauchi to adapt her short story into the play And the Soul Shall Dance because the story had included little dialogue, instead describing the characters\u2019 silent thoughts. The underlined sentence offers information about how Yamauchi ultimately succeeded in adapting the story into a play: it explains that Yamauchi created situations where the characters of the play could reveal their internal thoughts while speaking with each other.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole makes any mention of playwrights other than Yamauchi or how the play might have influenced them. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that Yamauchi is best known for her play And the Soul Shall Dance, which conveys that the play is better known than the short story it\u2019s based on is. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole mentions the actors who performed in the play or Yamauchi\u2019s approach to choosing them."

She goes on to explain that she is \"quick\" and \"tough.\" Based on these characteristics, she thinks she has a chance to join the team. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses solely on basketball and doesn\u2019t mention any other kinds of sports. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe aspects of the game of basketball. Instead, it provides the narrator\u2019s reasoning for thinking that she might make her school basketball team. Choice C is incorrect.

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nAlthough food writing is one of the most widely read genres in the United States, literary scholars have long neglected it. And within this genre, cookbooks attract the least scholarly attention of all, regardless of how well written they may be. This is especially true of works dedicated to regional US cuisines, whose complexity and historical significance are often overlooked.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nWith her 1976 cookbook The Taste of Country Cooking, Edna Lewis popularized the refined Southern cooking she had grown up with in Freetown, an all-Black community in Virginia. She also set a new standard for cookbook writing: the recipes and memoir passages interspersing them are written in prose more elegant than that of most novels. Yet despite its inarguable value as a piece of writing, Lewis\u2019s masterpiece has received almost no attention from literary scholars.",
    "question_text": "Based on the two texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely regard the situation presented in the underlined sentence in Text 2?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "As typical, because scholars are dismissive of literary works that achieve popularity with the general public",
      "As unsurprising, because scholars tend to overlook the literary value of food writing in general and of regional cookbooks in particular",
      "As justifiable, because Lewis incorporated memoir into The Taste of Country Cooking, thus undermining its status as a cookbook",
      "As inevitable, because The Taste of Country Cooking was marketed to readers of food writing and not to readers of other genres"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 states that literary scholars ignore regional cookbooks most of all, even when they have historical significance and are well written. So the author of Text 1 wouldn\u2019t be surprised that scholars ignored Edna Lewis\u2019s cookbook.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that scholars are dismissive of popular works in general. Instead, Text 1 says that scholars ignore food writing specifically, despite its popularity\u2014and despite the fact that it can be historically significant and complex. Choice C is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that elements of other genres should be kept out of cookbooks. Choice D is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never discusses how food writing is or should be marketed."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of political blogs. In this context, \"sanguine\" means optimistic. The text begins by noting the rise of political blogs with readily identifiable ideological alignments in the early 2000s. The text then indicates that some commentators saw this as a positive development, citing a reason why (their difference from traditional news). Finally, the text goes on to contrast those commentators with others who have a negative opinion of the rise of political blogs (because they increase political polarization among their readers). This context supports the idea that the second group of commentators is less positive than the first: thus, the second group of commentators is less optimistic, or sanguine.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it would not make sense in this context to describe those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs as less \"recalcitrant,\" or obstinately uncooperative, than those commentators who supported political blogs. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less \"misanthropic,\" or less contemptuous of humankind, than those commentators who have a positive opinion of political blogs\u2014there is no indication in the text that those commentators who like political blogs would be contemptuous of humankind at all. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less \"earnest,\" or sincere, than those who have a positive opinion of such blogs\u2014presumably, both groups of commentators hold their beliefs with equal conviction."

      "Basic",
      "Vague"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"rough\" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary\u2019s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there\u2019s \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn\u2019t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn\u2019t \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful."

      "A forgotten",
      "An incomplete"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as \"a void\" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature\u2019s \"surging life is at its full\" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be \"a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.\" The speaker says further that during summer, \"feeling sleeps / Gathering strength\" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn\u2019t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when \"feeling\" gathers \"strength for efforts yet to come.\" Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time \"when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,\" it doesn\u2019t discuss the season\u2019s relationship to the speaker\u2019s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"void\" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn\u2019t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker."

The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It\u2019s unclear how \"less deliberately signaled\" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"inadvertently\" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort."

As used in this context, \u201covershadowed by\u201d means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren\u2019t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn\u2019t suggest that state taxes are \u201cconsistent with,\u201d or in agreement with these other factors.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that state taxes are \u201crepresentative of,\u201d or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren\u2019t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text.

State taxes are irrelevant to peoples\u2019 decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that significant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples\u2019 choices to move, but they aren\u2019t completely unimportant."

A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of landscape. \u201cDon\u2019t belong in here,\u201d he fumed.\n\nAnd yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture \u201cfailed to fit in\u201d with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn\u2019t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is \u201csecretly proud of his acquisition.\u201d The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner\u2019s conflicted feelings about the new picture.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner\u2019s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there\u2019s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they\u2019re different from the new picture without explaining how they\u2019re different."

According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and\u2014more affordably\u2014steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe.",

      "It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.",
      "It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega\u2019s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn\u2019t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe\u2014nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn\u2019t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe."

The text indicates that there is a connection between Thomas\u2019s work and the flowers and trees in her home\u2019s garden, giving the example of Thomas\u2019s brushstrokes being inspired by light shining through the leaves of a tree in front of her house. This context conveys that Thomas\u2019s work was influenced by the flowers and trees in the garden.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Thomas drew inspiration for her work from the plants in her garden, which suggests that the flowers and trees contributed positively to her work, not that they \"restricted,\" or limited, her work. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that flowers and trees in a garden could have \"announced,\" or made known, a painter\u2019s work.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library. In this context, \"overlook\" means to ignore or to miss. The text states that artist and curator Joe Baker organized an exhibit that features Lenape beadwork in historical and modern works. The text describes the exhibit as \"essential viewing,\" suggesting that it\u2019s an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"complicate\" would mean to add difficulty, and there\u2019s no reason to think the text would need to directly caution against complicating Baker\u2019s exhibit; the text focuses on the idea that the exhibit is \"essential viewing,\" not on the idea of a potential difficulty that could be raised. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"amplify\" means to increase, and there\u2019s no reason to believe the text would indicate that it would be a mistake to increase an exhibit the text describes as \"essential viewing.\" Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that it would be a mistake to \"assemble,\" or put together, Baker\u2019s exhibit: the text makes it clear that the exhibit has already been put together and, further, praises the exhibit as \"essential viewing.\""

The text indicates that Franklin was very popular, or highly regarded, in France, where he sought the country\u2019s support for the United States in its fight for independence, and indicates that his status helped him achieve his goal. The context therefore suggests that being held in high regard by the people likely helped Franklin convince France to help the United States.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text directly indicates that it was Franklin\u2019s popularity that likely helped him convince France to help the United States, not his \"thoughtfulness\" (which in this context would mean either his careful reasoning and attention or his kind consideration of others\u2019 needs). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that there was any \"controversy,\" or dispute, about Franklin\u2019s presence in France; instead, the text states that Franklin was very popular in France and directly indicates that this status likely helped him convince France to help the United States.

    "prompt": "Text 1\n\nSome animal species, like the leopard, can be found in many kinds of areas. On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nA new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas.

Text 1 claims that temperature is the main factor that determines where these birds can live, while Text 2 claims that competition with other species is the main factor. However, both texts agree that these birds are not able to survive in many kinds of areas.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Neither text mentions the tools or methods that scientists use to observe these birds, either now or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about how these birds build their nests. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text provides any information about the genetic similarity of these birds, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this statement."

    "prompt": "Part of the Atacama Desert in Peru has surprisingly rich plant life despite receiving almost no rainfall. Moisture from winter fog sustains plants once they\u2019re growing, but the soil\u2019s tough crust makes it hard for seeds to germinate in the first place. Local birds that dig nests in the ground seem to be of help: they churn the soil, exposing buried seeds to moisture and nutrients. Indeed, in 2016 Cristina Rengifo Faiffer found that mounds of soil dug up by birds were far more fertile and supported more seedlings than soil in undisturbed areas.",

      "It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama Desert soil."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address the topic of the soil\u2019s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn\u2019t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. \u00a0Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identifies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil."

The text is referring to the particular view of the Port of Oakland as seen from a subway train as it rises from underground. This specific, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of fiction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Choice B is incorrect. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is significant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect. The point of the text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is significant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Bastos\u2019s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos\u2019s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos\u2019s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos\u2019s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics\u2019 opinion regarding the kea\u2019s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea\u2019s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics\u2019 opinion in this context must be that the kea\u2019s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos\u2019s claim that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea\u2019s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea\u2019s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to portray Francie\u2019s determination to reach her goal of reading all the books in the world. The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (\"she was still in the B\u2019s\") and that she struggled with some books (\"some of the B\u2019s had been hard going\"), she doesn\u2019t give up because she thinks of herself as \"a reader.\" These details show Francie\u2019s resolve.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn\u2019t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"\u2014that is, the boring books\u2014and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss Francie\u2019s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it\u2019s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn\u2019t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn\u2019t say whether Francie admires any of the books she\u2019s read so far.

The first sentence of the text introduces literary scholar Jeremy Douglass\u2019s warning to technology investors and enthusiasts against predicting the displacement of conventional books by newer media forms. The next sentence, which is underlined in part, presents Douglass\u2019s observation that interactive texts are hardly new; they have been available for longer than technologists assume, beginning with the first time readers wrote notes in texts\u2019 margins. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to challenge the stance of the technology investors and enthusiasts mentioned earlier in the text. As the remainder of the text points out, newer media doesn\u2019t necessarily replace older media, but rather, as Douglass believes, leads to new forms of expression.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion challenges the position taken by investors and enthusiasts; it doesn\u2019t provide context for their claims. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t mention academics or compare them to investors regarding their ability to see potential in using contemporary interactive texts; instead, the underlined portion challenges the position of investors and enthusiasts who predict that conventional books will be replaced by newer forms of media. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address technological challenges; instead, it disputes the stance taken by investors and enthusiasts, suggesting that conventional books haven\u2019t been displaced by traditional interactions with texts, such as writing in the margins, and won\u2019t be supplanted by newer forms of media either."

Ecologists\u2019 many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven\u2019t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nText 2\n\nEcologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton\u2019s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld\u2019s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, \u201cone species should emerge after outcompeting the rest\u201d\u2014that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is \u201cmuch less\u201d direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought.\u00a0\n\nChoice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specifically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because according to Text 2, Behrenfeld and colleagues argue that water density decreases, not increases, competition between phytoplankton species."

The text first provides Alice\u2019s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel\u2019s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice\u2019s plan is that it can be easily arranged.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice\u2019s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that it can be arranged \u201cfaintly,\u201d or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csimply\u201d can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word \u201chastily\u201d indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice\u2019s plan was made in haste, the text doesn\u2019t focus on this aspect of her plan.

Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csimply\u201d can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn\u2019t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn\u2019t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as \u201cthe best,\u201d and the narrator refers to the plan as \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cneatly,\u201d or efficiently, arranged."

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text\u2019s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey \"can persist across centuries and continents.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn\u2019t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn\u2019t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the findings by Chang and colleagues that\u2019s an \"alternative\" to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text."

The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can \"encompass,\" or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can \"conceal,\" or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel."

The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings.

In this context, to \"confirm\" means to establish the truth or correctness of something. The text explains that maize \"shows so little resemblance to any wild plant that genetic research was necessary\" to establish its ancestry, which was ultimately traced to teosinte grass. This context conveys the idea that scientific verification was required to establish an ancestral relationship with certainty\u2014that is, to confirm teosinte grass as maize\u2019s ancestor.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because to \"acquire\" means to obtain or gain possession of something. Although their research likely required scientists to acquire samples of maize and teosinte grass, the text does not suggest that this was the ultimate goal of their work, which instead probed the connection between the two plants. Choice B is incorrect because to \"develop\" means to create something or to promote the growth of something, and the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact in the deep past, which scientists then verified through research; because this relationship already existed, the scientists can\u2019t be said to have either created it or encouraged its growth. Choice C is incorrect because to \"attract\" means to entice something or to bring about a relationship or connection between two things, while the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact; rather than bringing about the relationship between the two plants, the scientists instead verified the prior existence of it."

In this context, \"exploited\" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals\u2019 magnetic fields.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"hypothesized\" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals\u2019 magnetic fields to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discounted\" would mean downplayed or ignored, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues minimized or ignored the tendency of the magnetic fields of some metals to change under stress. Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues\u2019 method of assessing the pipes\u2019 integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues \"redefined,\" or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals\u2019 magnetic fields to change under stress.

In this context, \"ambiguity\" means uncertainty or doubtfulness. The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by Gonz\u00e1lez claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence\u2014that is, with near certainty\u2014a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal\u2019s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inconspicuousness\" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn\u2019t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s team\u2019s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discretion\" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event\u2019s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"probability\" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood."

In the text, the narrator makes observations about her young niece, Dot, noting that Dot is making progress toward outgrowing babyhood and is growing stronger \"day by day.\" The description of Dot purposefully exercising by \"bouncing for hours\" reinforces the narrator\u2019s earlier characterization of Dot. The underlined sentence thus offers a detail that shows how Dot is growing stronger.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. While a sentence earlier in the text mentions Celestine\u2019s psychological state (sadness because Dot is growing fast), the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t focus on Celestine at all. Instead, the sentence focuses on Dot\u2019s physical activities to show that she is getting stronger.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, \u201clatent\u201d means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales\u2019 diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201creplicable,\u201d or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn\u2019t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn\u2019t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201cpredetermined,\u201d or decided in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn\u2019t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorrect because it\u2019s the opposite of what the context of the text is conveying. The second sentence of the text indicates that baleen whale accessory spleens may not be useless, not that they aren\u2019t \u201coperative,\u201d or functional."

As used in this context, \u201cperipheral\u201d means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire\u2019s territory rather than near its center.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire as \u201cunobtrusive,\u201d or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it\u2019s not clear how a province\u2019s physical location would or wouldn\u2019t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco\u2019s location was, the text emphasizes the province\u2019s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was \u201cconcealed,\u201d or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn\u2019t see it, and being hidden wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire was \u201capproximate\u201d would mean that the location either wasn\u2019t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco\u2019s location is known and that it was far from the empire\u2019s capital, so there\u2019s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun\u2019s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful\u2014solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth\u2014and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic\u2014increased brightness in a particular region of the corona\u2014comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun\u2019s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun\u2019s corona, which would not make logical sense."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old\u2014much older than the Clovis people\u2019s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces\u2014that they are human-made tools\u2014that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group\u2019s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn\u2019t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group\u2019s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent\u2019s first inhabitants. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought."

Choice B is incorrect because the text does not contrast the natural landscape with the speaker\u2019s state of mind or describe the wind shaking the seedpods as consistent; rather, the text suggests that the state of the natural world and the speaker\u2019s state of mind are similar in that both are unsettled.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to foreground Queen Dido\u2019s strong emotional response to Aeneas\u2019s story. Throughout, the text emphasizes how deeply the queen is affected by both Aeneas\u2019s tale and persona. At the outset, the speaker explicitly states that \"anxious cares...seiz\u2019d the queen\" and then uses the metaphor of fire (\"within her veins a flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\") to evoke the warmth of Dido\u2019s feelings for Aeneas. In addition, the line \"His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart\" suggests the deep impression that Aeneas\u2019s story makes on Dido, eliciting passion for him (\"improv[ing] the passion\") and empathy for his suffering (\"increas[ing] the smart\").\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there\u2019s no indication in the text that Dido is skeptical of Aeneas\u2019s account, much less that she\u2019s trying to conceal that skepticism. On the contrary, the text shows her being moved by his words and developing feelings for him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text mentions that Dido is impressed by Aeneas\u2019s \"valor, acts, and birth,\" which might suggest (but doesn\u2019t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn\u2019t represent Dido\u2019s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather, the text primarily emphasizes her emotional response\u2014specifically her attraction to Aeneas and her emotional investment in his story, indicating that his \"valor, acts, and birth inspire / Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire\" and that his words and looks elicit passion and empathy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas discovering a secret she is concealing from him. Though the text begins by mentioning Dido\u2019s \"anxious cares,\" this refers to her growing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suffering, not to worry about a secret she is concealing. The text\u2019s reference to a \"flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\" points to Dido\u2019s growing feelings for Aeneas that develop as he recounts his tale, not to a secret that existed before their encounter; moreover, the text provides no indication that Dido is worried Aeneas might discover these feelings."

    "question_text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the researchers\u2019 perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers?",
    "answer_choices": [
      "That behavior might have been due to the novelty of the magpies\u2019 captive setting rather than to the novelty of the tracker.",
      "That behavior likely indicates that the magpies were deliberately attempting to benefit themselves by obtaining the tracker.",
      "That behavior may not be evidence of selflessness in Gymnorhina tibicen because not all the captured magpies demonstrated it.",
      "That behavior might be adequately explained without suggesting that the magpies were attempting to assist the other magpie."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers\u2019 perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues\u2019 perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it\u2019s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they\u2019re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn\u2019t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals\u2019 curiosity about the new and unusual trackers."

The underlined sentence doesn\u2019t do this. It describes Cruse\u2019s criticisms\u2014it never mentions what Cruse did want the movement to do instead. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with the text, which argues that Cruse did disagree with almost all other scholars of the Civil Rights Movement. Choice C is incorrect. This is a step too far.

A 2020 study examining polar bear populations across the Arctic concluded that populations affected by sea-ice loss are at great risk of extinction by the end of the twenty-first century.\n\nText 2\n\nMonitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years. The researchers attribute this population\u2019s resilience in part to a shift in feeding strategies: in addition to hunting seals, the Svalbard polar bears have begun relying on a diet of reindeer meat and birds\u2019 eggs.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a \u201cstable and well nourished\u201d population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at \u201cgreat risk of extinction\u201d by the end of the century.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced \u201crapidly declining sea ice in recent years.\u201d Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specific to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn\u2019t mention any polar bear populations that haven\u2019t yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 doesn\u2019t imply that polar bears rely on a single seal-hunting strategy. In fact, the researcher in Text 2 would say that Text 1 fails to account for polar bears\u2019 ability to develop other hunting strategies and food sources."

As used in this context, \u201cconfined to\u201d means restricted to. The text says that Vel\u00e1zquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to say so in this context."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to make a case for the importance of Scott Joplin\u2019s less famous works. The text begins by introducing Joplin\u2019s most popular works and then goes on to assert that gaining a full understanding of Joplin\u2019s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes by characterizing the lesser-known works \"Pleasant Moments\" and Treemonisha as masterpieces that deserve to be famous. These details indicate that the text\u2019s main purpose is to argue that more attention should be given to Joplin\u2019s lesser-known works.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses some of the ragtime music and an opera that Joplin composed, it does not compare the two types of music in general. Instead, the text argues that Joplin\u2019s lesser-known works, including his opera, deserve as much attention as his more famous ragtime pieces receive. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses only Joplin\u2019s music and does not ask music lovers to listen to a variety of composers. Instead, the text encourages listeners to pay attention to Joplin\u2019s lesser-known works in order to gain a full understanding of his creativity.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe\u2019s novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, \"preserve\" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it\u2019s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he\u2019s fabricating the experiences he records."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The first part of the text presents the favorable opinions that others hold of Mr. Ely: the laity of Milby regard him as having \"remarkable powers and learning\" and assume that he also impresses people in London, while his fellow clergy see him as \"a discreet and agreeable fellow.\" The text then goes on to describe Mr. Ely\u2019s behaviors that enable him to cultivate and preserve his positive reputation. The text conveys that he avoids confrontations, abstaining from \"warm discussion[s]\" (that is, heated or contentious ones); that he avoids offending anyone by \"rarely [saying] what he thought himself\" and by refraining from openly ridiculing anyone; and that he doesn\u2019t give anyone any reason to ridicule or belittle his own character (\"he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him\"). In other words, these are all behaviors that suggest that Mr. Ely avoids doing anything that might make people dislike him or think poorly of him. Thus, the text begins by presenting the favorable view that people have of Mr. Ely and then describes the behaviors that enable him to maintain that favorable view.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe any events that caused people\u2019s regard for Mr. Ely to diminish. Instead, the text explains that the people of Milby hold him in high regard and describes behaviors that suggest how he cultivates that regard. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Mr. Ely\u2019s neighbors are more na\u00efve than Londoners are or that they\u2019ve been misled. Although the text suggests that Mr. Ely is very guarded in his outward behavior and conceals from people when he may be internally mocking them, which might suggest that people know him less well than they think they do, there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that Londoners are less na\u00efve and therefore less easily misled than Mr. Ely\u2019s neighbors are. The text states that the people of Milby believe Mr. Ely to be \"remarkable\" and that they assume that people in London must find him so, too; it doesn\u2019t say anything about what Londoners actually think of him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text discusses Mr. Ely\u2019s public conduct at length, describing the ways in which he carefully cultivates an agreeable public persona, the text doesn\u2019t discuss how Mr. Ely behaves in private at all; it therefore wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that the text begins by emphasizing a discrepancy between his public and private conduct. Furthermore, although the text concludes with examples illustrating that Mr. Ely typically doesn\u2019t share his true thoughts, indicating that he may be hiding aspects of his true personality when in public, and although the text as a whole conveys the idea that Mr. Ely benefits from this behavior, which might hint at his motives for doing so, the text doesn\u2019t conclude by alluding to those motives. Instead, the text merely concludes with a description of the behaviors he engages in to win his neighbors\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 approval."

Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, \u201cnegligible\u201d means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that \u201cin fact, as many as half\u201d the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase \u201cin fact\u201d establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible.\u00a0\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was \u201cinevitable,\u201d or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was \u201csatisfactory,\u201d or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was \u201ccommonplace,\u201d or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view."

In this context \u201cadhere to\u201d would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cexperiment with\u201d would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d The phrase \u201cexperiment with\u201d wouldn\u2019t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \u201cimprove on\u201d would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d The phrase \u201cimprove on\u201d wouldn\u2019t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201cgrapple with\u201d would mean to try hard to solve a difficult problem.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ronyoung Kim\u2019s novel Clay Walls. In this context, \"distinct\" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim\u2019s novel features three distinct perspectives.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"required,\" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There\u2019s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim\u2019s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unintended,\" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unknown,\" or not revealed, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel\u2019s perspectives are in fact known."

Further, placing the semicolon after \"though\" indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (interpretations of an outer solar system object\u2019s composition based on its color are ultimately speculative) is a qualification of the information in the previous sentence (the composition of an outer solar system object is suggested by its color).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the two main clauses with appropriate punctuation.

This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause \"which is known as Brownian motion\" is a nonessential supplement. Nonessential supplements need to be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a pair of commas, dashes, or parentheses, so we can\u2019t use a colon here. Also, notice that colons can only come after an independent clause, which isn\u2019t the case here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause \"which is known as Brownian motion\" is a nonessential supplement, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma after \"motion,\" so we need to add a comma before \"which.\" This choice is missing that comma. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. \"This type of random, continuous movement\" is not an independent clause and can\u2019t stand alone as a full sentence, so we can\u2019t put a period here."

This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the introductory participial phrase (\"Hoping\u2026classroom\") and the main clause (\"Huerta\u2026farmworkers\").\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"hoping.\" Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can\u2019t be used in this way to mark the boundary between the participial phrase (\"Hoping\u2026classroom\") and the main clause (\"Huerta\u2026farmworkers\"). Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the participial phrase (\"Hoping\u2026classroom\") and the main clause (\"Huerta\u2026farmworkers\")."

The nonfinite to-infinitive verb \u201cto study\u201d is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses chemistry and fossil evidence for (to study oceans as they were in the past).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite verb \u201chas studied\u201d can\u2019t be used in this way to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses the evidence for.
